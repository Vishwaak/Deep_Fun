Vishwaak Chandran:That's sad.
Shivangi:Ikr
Shivangi:It is in progress. I am writing stuff in react. It is a bit difficult. I am also learning about module css which I would like to apply in my Blog.
Vishwaak Chandran:I sincerely apologize for not sending the status on my blog. I had an end sem exam today and had a lot to write. I was asked to create a blog using gatsby on 4 th of november. Soon after that I got fever and was not able to work. And after one week I started to work again and learnt a bit of JSX syntax and react. Since the deadline was on sunday I was not able to learn more and also I had two lab exams on the same week and assignments to complete. I modified an example they provided and tried to run the code. But then it had a lot of issues. I trued changing the code a bit and also tried gatsby serve command instead of gatsby develop command, But then the issue isn't solved yet. I humbly request you to extend the deadline so that I can work on it properly and create the blog by myself, since this week I have 2 exams and some assignments and from 26 th I have the End sem exams and I have to study for tha too. I will try to complete it asap.

Vishwaak Chandran:oh
Chottu Foss:Break ups push you into a well. A well so deep that you can't even imagine. Lined with the bricks of memories, you fall and you keep on falling, It's unreal, initially, this freefall You don't believe it. You refuse to believe it. This can't happen. The eyes of the person who pushed you in, still etched in your mind, you continue to fall, And thud. You hit bare ground. Every part of your mind is screaming in pain. Every part of you is saying this didn't happen. Every part of you is in denial. You lie still for some time, staring at the beautiful bricks. Now there are two ways. You either get up, shake off the mud and try to climb back, Or you stay there, in the ground staring at the bricks. The way up is difficult, Impossible, it might look like To climb up all the way with your foot over those beautiful and fragile bricks. But let me warn you, my friend. The ground you are on, isn't the best place to be either. It's far from the reach of anyone, it's the coldest place on Earth. And if you do decide to get up and go back, Don't get up for the sole reason of confronting that person who pushed you in. That person destroyed you. I know. That person is someone you hate so much now. I know. But it's not worth it. Simply not worth it. Get up for someone who made you who you are. Parents, brothers, sisters, good friends. Get up for them. And if you can, you must get up for YOU. Your life is your battle. No one has to stay. Not even your parents or brother or sister or your friends. Once you find this loneliness, once you acknowledge it - there is no bigger happiness you can find in the entire world. You don't depend on someone for your happiness. You alone are the source of your own happiness. So, my friend, if you're in the well. Stop staring at the bricks. And this coming from someone who has climbed his way up, Let me tell you, my friend. The way up is all worth it, And that person never will be. Stop staring at the bricks.

Chottu Foss:this was like to have a community
Chottu Foss:if we need ppl for something, we can count on them, like for hackathons
Chottu Foss:we can post resources
Chottu Foss:rather than having people who couldnt join in the blind
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a good idea
Chottu Foss:yes krishnan ettan already had it two months ago as vibhoothi ettan said while he was screwing me :P
Vishwaak Chandran:Lol
Vishwaak Chandran:He evolved the idea
Vishwaak Chandran:Like we get to know what they are doing during the first two months of the task given

Chottu Foss:One of the biggest misnorm in the software engineering field today (I play in the field too) is women who have risen to the top of the field by being women advocates. Not by writing code, or building shit.
Chottu Foss:The only things on their profiles are: Leader: Women who code, Advocate: Tech in Pink.
Chottu Foss:I am like hey! This is Engineering. Build some shit
Chottu Foss:I am sure this happens in every subfield and corner of the western society
Chottu Foss:Sugar occasionally is fine but you have to consider the insulin spikes whenever you have it The reason most ppl get insulin resistant is from snacking on fast digesting carbs or drinking sodas throughout the day since that causes your insulin levels to go up and down drastically Ideally you wanna keep your insulin levels consistent so you don’t get really hungry which is why some ppl like having 4-6 meals a day Sugars at times like prewo or intrawo makes sense since you might be glycogen depleted which is why you see guys eating gummy bears before lifting
Chottu Foss:
Chottu Foss:Sounds strangely like aswin
Chottu Foss:fucker
Chottu Foss:where are you

Vishwaak Chandran:It, seems like the problem statement with vibhoothi Anna is not so good.
Vishwaak Chandran:We need to find new ones
Chottu Foss:Yeah
Vishwaak Chandran:We are mostly not going to do if we are jot going to get any profit
Vishwaak Chandran:For vidyut
Chottu Foss:ya
Vishwaak Chandran:So?
Chottu Foss:there is no gain other than publicity
Vishwaak Chandran:So we drop the event
Chottu Foss:thats my opinion yeah
Vishwaak Chandran:Hmm
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:How do we make sure it will not fetch us any profit?
Chottu Foss:make sure?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah
Vishwaak Chandran:I will put in better words
Chottu Foss:please do
Vishwaak Chandran:Why, do u say the event is only for pr?
Vishwaak Chandran:And why do you think we might not get any profit?
Chottu Foss:because - target crowd is jobless people coming to college not for learning but for having fun - its a hackathon. what hackathon fetches you money?
Chottu Foss:hackathons are done hand in hand with companies who want some problem to be solved
Vishwaak Chandran:So basically it's waste of time for us
Chottu Foss:yeah
Chottu Foss:apart from some extra PR that we could get from vidyut, I dont think it will be of use
Chottu Foss:if it was a "tech" fest, then ok
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah I get it
Chottu Foss:people are coming for nucelya, not hackathon :P
Vishwaak Chandran:Tru tho
Vishwaak Chandran:But what if actual people turn up for the event
Chottu Foss:even then PR is the only thing we gain
Chottu Foss:what will you do with PR when club is not stable
Vishwaak Chandran:And it's future gonna reduces the productivity of the club
Chottu Foss:PR and all are cream of the cake stuff, first let fourth years transition away
Chottu Foss:and let us stabiliise first years
Chottu Foss:they have been off track for last 2 months
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah it's going to be hard to pull them back to track
Vishwaak Chandran:We are gonna need lot of time and patience
Chottu Foss:theres a big mountain in front for them, that is gsoc
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah
Vishwaak Chandran:It's gonna need lot of chisel to cut down the mountain
Chottu Foss:you dont cut down the mountain you fool
Chottu Foss:you climb it
Vishwaak Chandran:The mountain is the granite mountain
Vishwaak Chandran:You cut precious rock from them
Chottu Foss:fuck off, heal the world
Vishwaak Chandran:: p
Vishwaak Chandran:
Chottu Foss:you dont get the scenery when you cut down the mountain
Vishwaak Chandran:I am dropping the event.
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah but you don't get money as well
Vishwaak Chandran:

Vishwaak Chandran:Anna can I go to the hackference in Bangalore?

Vishwaak Chandran:In bugzilla the status is fixed
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes Anna they reviewed it
Viboothi Anna:nice, can you please link me
Vishwaak Chandran:Sure will do it another 10 mins
Vishwaak Chandran:Anna we have registered for the hackference and we are planning to submit the following abstract. Yash Khare: ABSTRACT FOR THE E-WASTE PROJECT(Abhijit): In today's world, e-waste has become a major problem. This problem will only keep on increasing with time. Every day new models of laptops, mobile phones etc. are being released and Indians are the first in line to buy them. According to a recent survey: "It is expected that 118 million smartphones will be sold in India this year!", "With the annual growth rate of electronics market being 7% in India, it is anticipated to reach US$ 400 billion in 2022." This leads to another survey taken by the UN in 2016, according to which India is ranked 5th in the e-waste producing countries, producing a whopping 2 million tonnes of e-waste annually. Looking at all these statistics, it is impossible for us to imagine India without electronic gadgets. The loyal helpers that these equipments have become has made us unable to live without them. But the catch is that if we keep on producing these electronic items, there would come to a point where we cannot make them anymore due to the lack of raw materials are required to produce these electronics. The other aspect to be considered is the accumulation of e-waste. There is a rising problem of e-waste being imported to India. This would mislead the statistics and India would be blamed. But after all this, there are no Government policies to manage the e-waste being produced. If we take a closer look at the issue of E-waste that we are currently facing and the lack of raw materials that we could face in the future, there is a silver lining if we act fast. If we were able to transport the e-waste that is being produced on a day to day basis to the nearest recycling plant, the e-waste could be recycled into useful materials that could be reused to keep creating electronics. And in fact, there are many e-waste recycling plants in India. But inspite of having these recycling plants in India, people don’t know much about them so they hesitate to use them and they rather store the items in their house, waiting for an opportunity to sell them or just dump them off in an open ground which is very hazardous, and not to mention leading to the wastage of valuable resources. Our solution for this problem is an android app that would help people locate the nearest recycling plant. The app takes data like what type of e-waste people have. The database would have a log of which factory takes which kind of waste. The app would send the data to the factory and they could connect with the customer and discuss how they could transport the items to the factory for recycling. In addition to this, the customers can also contribute to the app by specifying the recycling centers they know about but are not in the app database. The app maintainers could verify the credibility of the user-supplied centers and add them to the database after proper verification.

Vishwaak Chandran:Anna should I learn rust?

Vishwaak Chandran:It has a rust.components inside..
Viboothi Anna:Guess it will be good if you learn
Viboothi Anna:First need you to plan for vacation
Viboothi Anna:In that add one hour of rust
Vishwaak Chandran:Okey Anna will start with it
Vishwaak Chandran:What all should I do in holiday?
Viboothi Anna:So Before going home It would be nice if you could spare sometime to make plan of what you are going to do in vacation and mail me I would like to see and if possible will reivew it so you could utilise the vacation more properly. Sorry for saying this late as I was off last weekends, and all. If you could spare one hour today or tomrow when you are bored it will be well and good and if you are busy with courseowork then do the planning after exams, just make sure that you review it from my side before working. Few things I made according to humanatrian consideration personally not like others, I strongly belvie these kind of things no one will say as people in our club (mostly seniors) will say like work 8 hours in vacation and much more, ask others you will understand. - Plan should have few things with 3 days one idea, just do one rough and I will help you to make it better. - Work of around 4 hours per day if possible, if you couldn't work one day, you could work the very next day and compenstae the work you planned to do on the previous day. - I would like to see seperate vaction update mail DAILY without any fail to me like Vacation: Status Update [XX-XX-XXXX], - You should take some days off like shopping, hanging out, tripping, dinners and all but just mention in that day update that so and so was the thing, in the worst case if you couldnt send mail just drop a message in telegram about the same to me. - In weekends you SHOULD NOT work, if you are doing so it should be only to compensate the work which you couldn't do in the weekdays. You should actually enjoy weekends. So obviously no updates on weekends unless u are working
Vishwaak Chandran:Okey Anna.... Will make a plan and let you know Anna...
Viboothi Anna:And did i help you in a anyway about reviewing
Vishwaak Chandran:You helped me a lot Anna...
Vishwaak Chandran:Anna what do you think about AI and machine learning? Can I learn them now?

Vishwaak Chandran:Anna if you don't mind ..can we do something like a hackathon for vidyuth?
Viboothi Anna:Who is we
Vishwaak Chandran:The club people
Viboothi Anna:Why sudden thought
Vishwaak Chandran:It was actually told to us to conduct a event for vidyuth by vipin sir a month ago even before the launch. We even had a meeting regarding it. But later on it was lost in time. Since we guys planning to the Foss event in September .we can probably use this to have jump start to that event.
Viboothi Anna:Did you guys discuss with Vidyut team ?
Vishwaak Chandran:No Anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Anna do I ask my mentor reviews about my wireframe diagram?
Viboothi Anna:Why not
Vishwaak Chandran:okay Anna will get it reviewd.
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna, Just wanted to ask you. My mentor says to put my wire frame model in the main Chanel. Shall I do it?
Vishwaak Chandran:
Viboothi Anna:Then ho ahead
Viboothi Anna:Go*
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello everyone I am a aspiring Gsoc student for this community and I went through the idea listed in the terllo . The Module Show case idea caught my attention immediately . I can up this wire frame mesh for the UI Design of the module tab to be implemented in game. I would love to hear some suggestions.
Viboothi Anna:Hello everyone, I am Viswaak, first year undergrad. Being contributing to Moving block's UI part for past few months. I am now thinking to do summer of code this year and I was wondering to do with "The Module Show Case" idea . I did a quick mockup of ui like a wireframe for the overall UI desgin for the module tab which is going to be implemented in the Game. It would be nice if someone could give there suggestions over this on how to make it better and flaws in this. I am not_at_all sure if this is correct or not.

Vishwaak Chandran:- First thing, 1k seems a lot for an event named Dive into Open Source. Since we have only seen and hosted such events for free, and yes, those students have or will be applying for GSoC as well. - What you are comparing your event to, is an International Event where people gather to attend talks and meet up with Companies and lots more. Your event description message starts with "Do you want to earn 3000$ in three months?", please do not compare the two, it's too big a stretch to pull off. I'm not undermining your event, but the point you're trying to prove is simply way off. - What speakers and start-ups/companies are coming at your event? What opportunities are you talking about that are 1000Rs worth to a student? Be specific, please. - Sure. No one is commenting that the workshop is bad, we are discussing that it doesn't seem worth it since 1000Rs is a roadblock for a talent young developer who wants to get in, but is hesitant to spend their pocket money on this. - It is for newbies, understood. I don't think you offended anyone, each and every one of us were putting in our opinions over this. Hope to see your reply soon.
Vishwaak Chandran:Anna questions ready
Viboothi Anna:[14/03, 9:59 AM] Siddarth Tr3x B-Grade: See when you create a question it should be ambiguous [14/03, 9:59 AM] Siddarth Tr3x B-Grade: Also straight forward [14/03, 10:00 AM] Siddarth Tr3x B-Grade: I would suggest remodeling this [14/03, 10:00 AM] Siddarth Tr3x B-Grade: Have a lot of experience guessing stuff for stupid CTFs..

Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna, The proposal is basically built on last year's proposal. Will correct those mistake and there is someother hook in it. They asked me to write a page or so on dynamic and static pages also the possible features which can be implemented. If they change it dynamic then I will have to rephase the entire proposal. Give me two days of time will get their opinion about the page.
Viboothi Anna:I am saying to explain everything why you prefer X over Y
Viboothi Anna:that is it
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna will be done
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna, I will not be coming to the lab today since I have not recovered from my health issues and also have a exam tomorrow. Regards, T. Vishwaak Chandran
Viboothi Anna:Ok
Viboothi Anna:Make sure you work of proposal
Viboothi Anna:For atleast an hour
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna
Viboothi Anna:Hi, Hope you are doing good. This message is to let you know that - I, myself, is going to take a step back from mentoring for some time due to few reasons and sir has asked me not to mentor anymore as well. Further, more importantly there is a lot of personal work that has been dragged along for months and multiple projects to do which I am afraid to say that I am finding it hard to provide little to no time left for me to mentor you guys. So you can talk to Staffs for having new mentor mapped to yourself and they will be also helping you to get your GSoC Proposal reviewed in the coming days. You can reach to them anytime and they will be there to help and mentor you. There are many others in the club who can mentor way better than me. Giving back to the club and making records/taking club to a different level/league was our sole motive. Becuase of this I know I have been over ethusiastic and might have made things worse, so I am sorry if I have been rude and made you stressed out due to me, it wasn't intentional and it was only meant for your goodness and for that of the club. You can reach out to the staffs if you have any questions. Best, Vibhoothi
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna, Is it something because of the irregular GSoC statues update?.If so I am extremely sorry. The GSoC proposal things has lot of confusion and I am fighting way in. I know all that you have done is the betterment of me and the club there was nothing rude in it. Even if you can give me small amount of time it's fine Anna. I don't want to lose you as a mentor. Sorry for all the inconvenience caused by me .I just wish you can mentor me more. Thank you for all the time you provided in past days in improving myself. You are the best mentor anyone can have. Thank you for everything Anna. Regards, Vishwaak
Viboothi Anna:Not anything due to status update, I am stopping mentoring as a whole as sir said
Vishwaak Chandran:Atlest can you be my unofficial mentor? Please.
Viboothi Anna:I don't have any problem in mentoring but sir don't want me to mentor anyone So stopping that's ut
Viboothi Anna:He believes club will be more smooth and friendly and less hostile environment if we stop mentoring
Viboothi Anna:So for betterment of club only We are stepping back
Vishwaak Chandran:If sir says so... Then it's better his way..
Viboothi Anna:Guess so
Vishwaak Chandran:Anna that Foss stall duty leave letter .Can I get a copy?

We had one volunteer per row but the number of girls are quite high in the group we need 3 girls to keep them comfortable. It's a complete hands-on workshop that means lot of doubt. I don't think two people will be able to handle the queries at the same time. Anyway abijith is only responsible for attendance. Manikishan Anna has joined us for the day.
Viboothi Anna:Okay
Viboothi Anna:Now manikshnan ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah

Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Viboothi Anna:.
Vishwaak Chandran:In this program, When you read from CLI, The read_line function writes everything to a buffer until it receives a newline. In this case, After you have typed an email, It is not going to do anything until you press enter. When you press enter, This is the text that is recieived by the program. As you can see, This is not a valid email. Use trim_whitespace or something similar to get rid of newline and extra whitespaces and then try to validate it.
Viboothi Anna:Got it
Viboothi Anna:yp
Viboothi Anna:that was it
Viboothi Anna:there was a whitespace
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay cool :)

Vishwaak Chandran:I am able to see all the old messages
Viboothi Anna:.
Viboothi Anna:wait was you there earlier
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:No I wasn't
Viboothi Anna:Okay
Viboothi Anna:„ final update“
Vishwaak Chandran:Will go through.. Right now in mess
Viboothi Anna:sad
Vishwaak Chandran:The blogs amazing : )
Viboothi Anna:i know
Viboothi Anna:flowchart
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah set
Viboothi Anna:ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:Is there any update over the attendance
Vishwaak Chandran:Done with the client side script
Viboothi Anna:Uploaded to GH?
Viboothi Anna:GitHub?
Vishwaak Chandran:Not Yet
Viboothi Anna:do it
Viboothi Anna:in proper repo with proper readme things
Viboothi Anna:Also I would like to test properly on macOS too, since its totally different
Vishwaak Chandran:I have to run few test before i can do a PR.
Viboothi Anna:Ok, please do it ASAP
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay will keep that in mind
Viboothi Anna:by 30th or 1st Sept, we have to make sure it is production ready and ready to serve
Viboothi Anna:we should make track of first years
Vishwaak Chandran:client side will be ready by tonight
Vishwaak Chandran:server side tom at max.
Viboothi Anna:okay
Vishwaak Chandran:No delay other than that.
Viboothi Anna:ok
Viboothi Anna:Hi
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello anna
Viboothi Anna:Is ot the thing you mentioned
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah
Viboothi Anna:How's this
Vishwaak Chandran:Will check this out and get back to you.
Viboothi Anna:It is deep learning
Vishwaak Chandran:yes
Vishwaak Chandran:which is a sub set of ML
Viboothi Anna:Is it fine?
Vishwaak Chandran:they haven't taugh you CNN right ? or anything related to deep learning ?
Viboothi Anna:No
Vishwaak Chandran:Then it's preferd not to take it because you don't have it in your course work.
Viboothi Anna:Okay
Viboothi Anna:If you are free See something with image processing jpeg
Viboothi Anna:Ml
Vishwaak Chandran:okay anna will try finding something out.
Vishwaak Chandran:All this are deep learning
Viboothi Anna:This too?
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:gans are deep learning models .
Viboothi Anna:Crap
Viboothi Anna:How's thiz
Viboothi Anna:Deep?
Viboothi Anna:Can't read full Ss please
Vishwaak Chandran:no
Vishwaak Chandran:it's just a optimization to a compression algo .
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:This is really good project
Viboothi Anna:what is this actually doing
Viboothi Anna:like regression anda ll
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a classification problem .
Viboothi Anna:doable ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:One month more than enough.
Viboothi Anna:Or this ?
Viboothi Anna:This is about whole JPEG, Third step is Block Splitting i was thinking to do some regression or classification over it
Viboothi Anna:and predict the best block
Vishwaak Chandran:what will be your base condtition if you want to split the images to smaller tiles?He has used normal algo to do split the image into titles i am not sure how will regression model will help you out in this process .
Viboothi Anna:s/titles/blocks
Viboothi Anna:like predicting which to do ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Nah i don't think we can find any pattern in it.
Vishwaak Chandran:gans's
Vishwaak Chandran:this is okaish trying to cluster similar kind of pixels and then replacing them with a single color . It's a short project.
Viboothi Anna:10:18 <xiphmont> you have a problem there--- the splitting problem, algorithmically is solved by Vitterbi trellises. 10:19 <xiphmont> Deciding if one split is better than another relies on some metric--- and none match the human visual system well. 10:19 <xiphmont> coming up with a better metric is fantastically difficult-- because only humans can be the final arbiter. 10:19 <xiphmont> E.g., look at VMAF, which is trying to do ~ ewhat you suggest. 10:20 <xiphmont> and it's.... really unreliable. 10:20 <xiphmont> and very slow 10:20 <xiphmont> maybe not even better than something really simple like MSSIM
Viboothi Anna:So scrapped
Viboothi Anna:This or
Viboothi Anna:This
Vishwaak Chandran:This will be a better one to do.
Viboothi Anna:Why so?
Vishwaak Chandran:The other one is to short and the current one i am suggestig has lot of other implementation in real life .
Viboothi Anna:like
Vishwaak Chandran:*Your system helps gardeners and farmers to increase their productivity and yield with the help of automating tasks in garden/farm.* this one and you can try to deploy into Raspberry Pi to look after you plants .
Viboothi Anna:so what is the title of the project
Vishwaak Chandran:Flower Species Recognition ?
Viboothi Anna:or should we take some other dataset and do the same
Vishwaak Chandran:we can do that .
Viboothi Anna:like what we can do
Viboothi Anna:bascially this is a normal classificaiotn which all basics people does right? or is ti something different
Vishwaak Chandran:This is a normal classification problem .
Viboothi Anna:okay
Viboothi Anna:if we see this, this is not normal Clustering tho :?
Vishwaak Chandran:It's like some real life application of the model as your trying to compress the image .
Vishwaak Chandran:It's not normal clustering .
Viboothi Anna:so this is not normal classification?
Vishwaak Chandran:That is normal classification problem.
Viboothi Anna:then how is it good :o
Vishwaak Chandran:We usual do flower classification problem as a part of CNN.
Vishwaak Chandran:Which one ?
Viboothi Anna:I see cool then
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay : )
Viboothi Anna:no idea if it is good or not
Vishwaak Chandran:Will register and attend if it's good will continue with webinar else will drop it.
Viboothi Anna:before register
Viboothi Anna:find out more
Viboothi Anna:webinar is remote?
Viboothi Anna:or is it from Kollam?
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay will find all the details before registering .
Viboothi Anna:ok
Viboothi Anna:ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:anna made the changes to the script so that it works in mac os do check .
Viboothi Anna:will check in a while
Viboothi Anna:I coudln’t find
Viboothi Anna:did you push ? I cannot see commits that is why I was aksing you
Vishwaak Chandran:It's not in master
Vishwaak Chandran:Check devl branch
Viboothi Anna:why not in devel ?
Viboothi Anna:why new branch
Vishwaak Chandran:I though that branch was deleted
Viboothi Anna:ok
Vishwaak Chandran:If it's right please merge it into master.
Viboothi Anna:please create a PR
Viboothi Anna:like that only we can review
Vishwaak Chandran:For?
Viboothi Anna:merging into devle
Viboothi Anna:master
Viboothi Anna:from devl
Vishwaak Chandran:Will do it
Viboothi Anna:ok
Viboothi Anna:it is crashing fyi
Viboothi Anna:did it compile sucessuflly
Viboothi Anna:?
Vishwaak Chandran:OK I expected that . I though it will able to choose the path if one of them returns true but it's not able to.
Viboothi Anna:syntax erro?
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:File not found error
Vishwaak Chandran:Run time error
Viboothi Anna:Is it like that
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:This thing is reading and writing from two different files.
Vishwaak Chandran:What I wrote was if it can't find the file one location it should choose from. Another location which failed. So it's better if we set a flag and change the directory on basis of that.
Viboothi Anna:expect works better?
Vishwaak Chandran:It might
Viboothi Anna:I see
Viboothi Anna:I know few people from that org
Viboothi Anna:Kangami
Viboothi Anna:Y4m decoder in rust has some to do in rav1e
Vishwaak Chandran:Y4m is a developing project based on rav1e right ?
Viboothi Anna:no
Viboothi Anna:ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:Call back after exam
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay cool
Vishwaak Chandran:Shall I call now?
Viboothi Anna:will call soon
Vishwaak Chandran:oaky cool
Viboothi Anna:ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes Anna
Viboothi Anna:how is mayuk>?
Vishwaak Chandran:He is working on his projects
Viboothi Anna:IDC
Viboothi Anna:what about tasks?
Vishwaak Chandran:He is processing but in a very slow pace.
Vishwaak Chandran:Will ask, him to speed up the process .
Viboothi Anna:make sure that his first focus is tasks if not we cannot entertain people with self motive
Viboothi Anna:say him to only do tasks, if he does taht we can make sure that he can do other crap
Viboothi Anna:if he cannot do tasks then i won’t promtoe his projects
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay cool will let him know that.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay.
Viboothi Anna:I have said to him earlier about it
Viboothi Anna:so what all tasks he did after that mail things and all
Viboothi Anna:I think it is 0
Vishwaak Chandran:Mail thingy was completely rubbish
Viboothi Anna:we have set the things like tasks for everyone,
Viboothi Anna:I am pretty confident about Akshay but I won’t allow him to do other things
Viboothi Anna:his primary focus is tasks that is i t
Viboothi Anna:til end of vacation
Vishwaak Chandran:I asked to refactor the entire code. After that we have 0 progresses from him regarding the tasks.
Viboothi Anna:After that we can make him do other things
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay first the task then he can do whatever he wants.
Viboothi Anna:That was the standing instructions which we gave the first day to mentors and also to mentees
Vishwaak Chandran:I remember.
Viboothi Anna:then why was you not like that
Viboothi Anna:you was kinda okay with him doing other stuff
Viboothi Anna:his „personal“ stuff
Vishwaak Chandran:He was making a progress in his project I did not wanted to disturb the current project he is working on.
Vishwaak Chandran:So I though will give him some time to complete the project.
Viboothi Anna:I did not want him/her to do any project now that is another thing
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay.
Viboothi Anna:we will only evaluate people after vacation soley based on tasks right since that is comon across all
Vishwaak Chandran:But he made good progress for the capcha breaking.
Viboothi Anna:what is there to process in that task
Vishwaak Chandran:People usually get a image and then give the output but this guy. Selects the image online and then process produces a output.
Vishwaak Chandran:It's bit more than what's required.
Viboothi Anna:I see okay
Viboothi Anna:Make sure that he fixes all issues in tasks he did and gets full points for that
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay that's what I instructed him to do for the rusted email.
Viboothi Anna:Ok
Viboothi Anna:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes.
Viboothi Anna:Task 4 - Advanced XOR Task 5 - Get it using JavaScript Task 6 - CLI App using Golang ( tried ) Task 7 - Rusted email ( tried ) Task 10 - CS50 Task 11 - Pong game Task 13 - Project euler ( did a few of them, not all ) Task 14 - Bandit Why these much pending for him
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes ik he couldn't complete it completely. The code doesn't work for some corner cases.
Vishwaak Chandran:I asked him to improve that.
Viboothi Anna:Cli app Rusted email Bandit Getit using js Without these, I would support him being part of club
Viboothi Anna:-1 from my side
Viboothi Anna:IDC whatsoever he did as extra, if he cannot follow basic club rules, no need for him to be part of club
Vishwaak Chandran:He was not feeling well and he was traveling for more than 2 days.
Viboothi Anna:It's not about now
Viboothi Anna:He was having plethora time as he was in home
Viboothi Anna:Till now
Viboothi Anna:More a month
Vishwaak Chandran:I asked him to complete the task, I even had talk for 20-25 mins about the importance of the tasks.
Viboothi Anna:We can discuss in intenral
Viboothi Anna:I did start
Viboothi Anna:What i am proposing is, move to batch B
Viboothi Anna:As he did not do any foss related things
Viboothi Anna:After interview
Vishwaak Chandran:But he is a very good gamble we would have.
Viboothi Anna:Yes
Viboothi Anna:Once he do this then I am okay
Viboothi Anna:Else i will NOT support his being part of club
Viboothi Anna:It's ur club, you guys decide
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay then I will put some pressure on getting them complete.
Viboothi Anna:I don't have any major issues, if you think he can be good then take him
Viboothi Anna:I personally don't think so
Viboothi Anna:Due to his this attitude
Vishwaak Chandran:I haven't meet him in physical life. Once I meet him I can then clearly state whether he is a team player or not.
Viboothi Anna:ML_p2
Vishwaak Chandran:Shall I ask vipin sir?
Viboothi Anna:for what ?
Vishwaak Chandran:But we don't have thing conform. So I am just waiting to get a solid plan
Vishwaak Chandran:For the stall
Viboothi Anna:First talk to Rahul ettan or shogil ettan
Viboothi Anna:then talk to sir
Viboothi Anna:you take the lead and do everything
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay cool will talk to shogil Anna about it
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Should i also ask the 4th year or only till 3rd years ?
Viboothi Anna:From 4th years Me have all Aniketh have all Venu I am not 100% sure but yeah Krishnan none Ram Manoj none AFAIK Sandesh have email I think but idk check again
Viboothi Anna:It would be better if you ask To Venu Sandhesh
Viboothi Anna:To get exact details
Vishwaak Chandran:okay
Viboothi Anna:started doing?
Vishwaak Chandran:Completed
Viboothi Anna:so okay, so I should ask for link?
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:I was about to send it now
Viboothi Anna:?
Vishwaak Chandran:Sorry wrong sheet
Viboothi Anna:who Tf keeps [amfoss] in last
Vishwaak Chandran:I kept it for my my reference
Viboothi Anna:it is „GitHub“
Viboothi Anna:And also I don’t have access to facebook
Viboothi Anna:and yeah I have CMS staff access
Vishwaak Chandran:You said everything .
Viboothi Anna:yeah I forgot about Facebook
Viboothi Anna:does that thing exist :p
Vishwaak Chandran:What about server ?
Viboothi Anna:no
Vishwaak Chandran:: )
Viboothi Anna:add one more coloumn server
Vishwaak Chandran:only aniketh anna?
Viboothi Anna:no Ashwin has
Viboothi Anna:aniketh Idk if he has access
Vishwaak Chandran:I rememeber ashwin asking cred from aniketh anna
Viboothi Anna:okay, ask to them and confirm
Viboothi Anna:[Internal] amfOSS Credentials Access
Vishwaak Chandran:Done
Viboothi Anna:gitHub gives Cancer
Viboothi Anna:make it GitHub
Vishwaak Chandran:lol
Viboothi Anna:Delete plox
Viboothi Anna:Since lab will be anyway open
Viboothi Anna:What's need to say it is open
Vishwaak Chandran:It's done.
Vishwaak Chandran:Yesterday people didn't turn up in the lab until we had to told in the group
Viboothi Anna:Say to them that, lab will be open
Viboothi Anna:Directly
Viboothi Anna:Before 10
Viboothi Anna:Mostly 930
Viboothi Anna:On holidays
Viboothi Anna:I did say long back
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay will convey them directly
Viboothi Anna:Since they could blame that we was late for informing If we didn't do, and they late, we can say that it's their issue even if it was 5mins before they cane after lab opening
Viboothi Anna:5mins after*
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh yeah that's a good move
Viboothi Anna:Since 2+ years
Vishwaak Chandran:Experience : )
Viboothi Anna:Check it
Viboothi Anna:And let me know if it is good
Viboothi Anna:Photo from vibhoothi
Viboothi Anna:Cm tweeted
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a really awesome opportunity to push our club.
Vishwaak Chandran:It's good and the contents are about aws and game development in unity worth a try.
Viboothi Anna:Discuss in group then
Viboothi Anna:Why
Viboothi Anna:Oops, Date 26,27
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a really good chance.
Viboothi Anna:But the thing is, the software is there
Viboothi Anna:12+ years oss
Viboothi Anna:See who Red cross Nia And mant people use this
Vishwaak Chandran:So we have to re-invent the enitre wheel that's not a good idea. But if you can add more features which will improve disaster management for a place like india and ig mostly the software will be OSS . I feel there might be a chance they can give us the chance to maintain the project.
Viboothi Anna:Maybe It depends
Viboothi Anna:How we can make this more Indian
Viboothi Anna:We could do it
Viboothi Anna:No much work
Vishwaak Chandran:I was thinking of something like based on the weather report of a place predicting whether that might place might get affected and if supposed a place chennai is flooded we can suggest that flooded water can be directed into the water tables of that place. So basically solution tailered for each and every place in india according to their environment.
Viboothi Anna:
Viboothi Anna:Still don't know to mail?
Vishwaak Chandran:It was a lot of things so I though I would send them in point else it would have been in a single paragraph.
Viboothi Anna:No
Vishwaak Chandran:Then?
Viboothi Anna:To field
Viboothi Anna:Still u got marked
Viboothi Anna:As you did send
Viboothi Anna:New bug found
Vishwaak Chandran:No wait I just tapped on the daily thread I have no idea how it got switched.
Vishwaak Chandran:Probably that could have happened.
Viboothi Anna:Fix it
Viboothi Anna:The bug
Viboothi Anna:Assigned to you
Viboothi Anna:Script is made by chirath ettan
Viboothi Anna:Discuss with Ashwin and Harshit
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay will, do it before lunch.
Viboothi Anna:It might not be easy as u think
Viboothi Anna:Cc shouldn't have
Viboothi Anna:Only mailing lsit
Vishwaak Chandran:
Viboothi Anna:Not needed
Viboothi Anna:It should be only in to field
Viboothi Anna:To ML
Vishwaak Chandran:ashwin and harshit are planning to revamp the enitre script with that the bug will be fixed.
Viboothi Anna:ok
Viboothi Anna:I would definitely not go forward withhim
Viboothi Anna:This guy said he don’t ahve time to come to lab and do stuff and it seems he have time for non-sense
Viboothi Anna:Namah Shivaya, I won't be coming to the lab today because I have a lot to catch up on studies, especially in chemistry. Also I have to do laundry.
Vishwaak Chandran:They are some core concepts in creating a deep learning model i would say he is going on the correct path but the problem with him is that he has missed periodicals so he is taking some time off to read for them. I don't think it's bad.
Viboothi Anna:my question is WHY THE FUCK is he DOING DEEP LEARNIGN without doing tasks
Viboothi Anna:IDC about whtt other activities he did
Viboothi Anna:I really don’t bohter about i t
Vishwaak Chandran:I had attempted Advanced xor long back, but it didn't work then because the ciphertext was wrong, so I left it CS50 and a few corner cases in Euler left
Vishwaak Chandran:That's the final standing with his tasks.
Viboothi Anna:so waht all pending ?
Viboothi Anna:for him?
Vishwaak Chandran:that's the remaining task he has.
Viboothi Anna:getgitdetials? go tasks ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Done.
Viboothi Anna:so pending is Advance XOR CS50 Few Euler tasks?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes that's all
Viboothi Anna:Did you check the things he did?
Viboothi Anna:The tasks
Vishwaak Chandran:Checked his rust task, go task i haven't checked.
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna.. can I call you?
Viboothi Anna:yes
Viboothi Anna:ssup ?
Vishwaak Chandran:It's regarding the duty leave
Vishwaak Chandran:We have e a sample dry run in the afternoon .
Viboothi Anna:Pudding life
Vishwaak Chandran:Messed up message
Vishwaak Chandran:Let's forget something like that happened Anna
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:Happy birthday Anna
Viboothi Anna:Thanks @!\/ !\!@
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:Abhijit Abhishek BVS Ajay Akhil Athira Drishya Gopa lasya Sevegen Shivangi Vaishnav Vishwaak Yash Gowtham
Viboothi Anna:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:Kya hua
Vishwaak Chandran:Model training remaining
Vishwaak Chandran:Right now writing record after that will take a look into it.
Viboothi Anna:Okay
Viboothi Anna:Eta
Viboothi Anna:Cool
Vishwaak Chandran:45 mins
Viboothi Anna:What about unsupervised learning?
Viboothi Anna:Are we having it?
Vishwaak Chandran:I don't think so
Vishwaak Chandran:This project is completely based on supervised learning
Viboothi Anna:If we have that, it would be great
Viboothi Anna:Some way or other, if we can show unsupervised
Viboothi Anna:?
Vishwaak Chandran:Will try getting that in.
Viboothi Anna:If taking too much time then no
Viboothi Anna:Keep it for last
Vishwaak Chandran:You can use unsupervised learning for creating new flowers
Viboothi Anna:And alzo send the colab vala
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah
Viboothi Anna:ok?
Viboothi Anna:then
Vishwaak Chandran:It's done
Vishwaak Chandran:I can implement a unsupervised algo
Viboothi Anna:aha
Viboothi Anna:so what all there
Vishwaak Chandran:Everything as said in the tutorial
Vishwaak Chandran:Still few changes to be done in the test test once that's done. Will have to check if the model's are fitting properly or there is an ovr or under fit.
Viboothi Anna:in different way ? or same way
Viboothi Anna:same tutorail + new dataset
Vishwaak Chandran:yes
Viboothi Anna:ETA?
Vishwaak Chandran:11:30 am
Viboothi Anna:will you hve time to implement unsupervised ones?
Vishwaak Chandran:i have a DS exam in the afternoon
Vishwaak Chandran:so after that possible.
Viboothi Anna:cool
Viboothi Anna:so now you are doing this?
Viboothi Anna:studied DS?
Vishwaak Chandran:yes
Vishwaak Chandran:not yet started.
Viboothi Anna:go and study
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah will study
Viboothi Anna:Hi
Viboothi Anna:Ssup
Viboothi Anna:Em having dinner Will be there soon
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello
Vishwaak Chandran:okay cool
Viboothi Anna:Evaluation pattern of ml project review 1. Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization- 10 marks 2. Supervised learning algorithm implementation comparison and performance plots -20 marks 3. Unsupervised learning algorithm implementation or usage of atleast two algs - 10 marks Evaluation will be on individual basis
Viboothi Anna:we have all the things here ?
Viboothi Anna:what are the changes from these
Vishwaak Chandran:It's just the dataset changes and some file struct
Viboothi Anna:File struct?
Vishwaak Chandran:dataset
Viboothi Anna:ok
Viboothi Anna:any progress?
Vishwaak Chandran:working on it
Viboothi Anna:Then
Vishwaak Chandran:Still no progress.
Viboothi Anna:Worst case, cna we have old dataset itself
Vishwaak Chandran:It's too much messed up
Viboothi Anna:Backip plans
Vishwaak Chandran:we can do something like this .
Vishwaak Chandran:Can i implement a NN for unsupervised learning ?
Vishwaak Chandran:If that's possible then you can tell him/her that you have used four models to train on dataset .
Viboothi Anna:Hi
Viboothi Anna:Kaggle
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:I have like 20 mins more Would require to show some deliverable
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:Rf is having a good value now
Viboothi Anna:Here it is not visible
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh
Vishwaak Chandran:Upload the kaggle json file and everything should start working
Viboothi Anna:Lr iz rhere?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:What doesn't work now
Vishwaak Chandran:The prediction part
Viboothi Anna:What to do for that
Vishwaak Chandran:I can manually manuplate.
Vishwaak Chandran:It
Vishwaak Chandran:Shall I do it?
Viboothi Anna:Eta?
Viboothi Anna:ok?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes I found out the mistake it was not the classifier making mistake but the output being printed that's why all the images were getting the same class name. I have removed the class name on the predicted images and printed them below.
Viboothi Anna:so it is working?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:everything done?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes cleaning the code.
Viboothi Anna:let me know once it is done?
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Viboothi Anna:why did we use „tensor“
Vishwaak Chandran:Where?
Viboothi Anna:to tensor
Vishwaak Chandran:To make it more easy for processing data
Viboothi Anna:what about mahotas
Vishwaak Chandran:That's for extracting a feature from the images.
Viboothi Anna:okay
Viboothi Anna:when wil itbe done?
Vishwaak Chandran:Stupid internet here
Vishwaak Chandran:I want to check once
Vishwaak Chandran:Can you check the last cell?
Viboothi Anna:trying to run all
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay awesome : )
Viboothi Anna:it is sl
Viboothi Anna:t
Viboothi Anna:too slow
Vishwaak Chandran:Which one?
Viboothi Anna:All
Viboothi Anna:Re running all
Vishwaak Chandran:Train it on gpu
Viboothi Anna:Do it please
Vishwaak Chandran:Where are you?
Viboothi Anna:Canteen
Vishwaak Chandran:I will be there in 25 mins
Viboothi Anna:Is prediction working?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Viboothi Anna:You Ran it?
Vishwaak Chandran:Running
Viboothi Anna:completed running?
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:What happened?
Viboothi Anna:in my colab it is meesedd up
Viboothi Anna:some are having keyboard interuppted
Vishwaak Chandran:??
Vishwaak Chandran:That's because you stopped the cell when it was running
Viboothi Anna:code is completed right
Viboothi Anna:I am going to make a new notebook
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Viboothi Anna:so
Viboothi Anna:which is unsupervised
Viboothi Anna:logistic?
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:K-means
Vishwaak Chandran:I am going afk for 15 mins
Viboothi Anna:cool
Viboothi Anna:where is that? In-built library right
Vishwaak Chandran:In the import library
Vishwaak Chandran:That graph you get it's of kmeans
Vishwaak Chandran:Box plot for supervised
Vishwaak Chandran:Graphs for unsupervised
Viboothi Anna:ok cool
Viboothi Anna:are you coming?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:In front of college gate
Viboothi Anna:Ping
Viboothi Anna:Same error on yours too
Vishwaak Chandran:Hullo
Viboothi Anna:yes
Vishwaak Chandran:Event code for clean up drive
Viboothi Anna:SEV01
Viboothi Anna:IIUC
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Thank you
Vishwaak Chandran:Anna added aniruth Anna to the Foss mentor group
Viboothi Anna:Ok
Viboothi Anna:Why
Vishwaak Chandran:He is a mentor right?
Viboothi Anna:Who is mentee
Vishwaak Chandran:Harshith
Viboothi Anna:Ok
Viboothi Anna:ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello
Viboothi Anna:Why did Kasthuri CC you and shivangi in yesterday’s update
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a stupid thing
Viboothi Anna:I DO NOT want people to CC mentors in Mailing List if they want, please advise them to mail seperatly else do not do
Viboothi Anna:what is it
Vishwaak Chandran:I asked her to do it. Then she said she has no time for writing spectate email.
Viboothi Anna:Then you should, you do not have time to mentor
Viboothi Anna:if she cannot even „draft a seperate update mail“ then there is no point of mentoring and investing time
Vishwaak Chandran:I told her don't email the same content if it's the same thing in status update.
Viboothi Anna:Say to her, it is for „her“ not for you
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah intentioned her regarding why we need a spectate email.
Vishwaak Chandran:But still no effect.
Viboothi Anna:ok
Viboothi Anna:ping
Viboothi Anna:Yes chetta
Viboothi Anna:Why have you CC’d Vishwaak and Shvangi in ML thread
Viboothi Anna:Because I didn't get time to send a separate mail these days
Viboothi Anna:We don’t CC people in ML as it is not the way.
Viboothi Anna:and boom no reply
Vishwaak Chandran:I told you
Vishwaak Chandran:Will keep her informed.
Viboothi Anna:what is her progresss?
Viboothi Anna:and how is she
Vishwaak Chandran:Slow progressing
Vishwaak Chandran:She is moving forward.
Viboothi Anna:How is „shivangi“
Vishwaak Chandran:Less interaction with mentee
Viboothi Anna:does she know to „mentor“
Vishwaak Chandran:And I don't feel she is looking into the updates.
Vishwaak Chandran:I ain't sure
Viboothi Anna:eh, some grammer issuer
Viboothi Anna:is she looking ? =
Vishwaak Chandran:No, reply from her side.
Vishwaak Chandran:No follow ups
Viboothi Anna:ok sure, discuss and chance her if needed
Viboothi Anna:I wanted to make sure this
Viboothi Anna:I said this, before monitoring from what she and her said
Viboothi Anna:and now it is QED
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay will talk to other people and let you know.
Vishwaak Chandran:QED?
Vishwaak Chandran:I think her response to mentee is too slow.
Vishwaak Chandran:That could be the main reason.
Viboothi Anna:Yes, I don’t want any person to be lagged or not worked due to mentor’s fault
Viboothi Anna:She has some potentail (Kasthuri) which can be made better with good mentoring, here it is not happening
Vishwaak Chandran:Btw, I talked to gopavasth Anna over phone and he informed me about openstack thing and mediawiki thing on the same dates on fossnight. I started out a bit harsh on him. Is it bad?
Vishwaak Chandran:I understand will make sure nothing like that happens. No mentee will not be spoilt by any mentor
Viboothi Anna:so on Dec 8 _ Open Stack Event _ Mediawiki _ FOSSNight ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes original plan was only FOSSnight
Vishwaak Chandran:Then all out of a sudden mediawiki thing and openstack thing popped up.
Vishwaak Chandran:He says it was decided by sir.
Viboothi Anna:„date is not decided by sir“
Vishwaak Chandran:Am I in fault for talking harsh to him?
Viboothi Anna:not at all
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay anna.
Viboothi Anna:I know that. I didn't mean it. I am so sorry for the mistake I did. I was busy with my class works and that was y I didn't send the proper status update to my mentors. The actual thing is that I did like that for 5 days on which 2 days I wasn't well and I thought if I cc them they will know it and rest of the days I had a lot of works to do.
Vishwaak Chandran:During those two days I informed her it's not necessary to send a separate update if your just gonna forward a the daily thread.
Vishwaak Chandran:I also informed why she needs to send a separate status update.
Viboothi Anna:ok fine

Vishwaak Chandran:So what do we do?
Vishwaak Chandran:Change mentor?
Viboothi Anna:She said like she tried to help but she is not able to or so
Viboothi Anna:Yes

Viboothi Anna:Someone require to talk to shivanfi
Vishwaak Chandran:Will take care
Vishwaak Chandran:Venu Anna is perfect for that
Vishwaak Chandran:He has a good rapo with her
Viboothi Anna:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello
Viboothi Anna:Why tehre is a seperate catogery for research stuff
Viboothi Anna:Who mad eit ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Because it has to be build from framework
Viboothi Anna:?
Vishwaak Chandran:There is no existing work on it.
Viboothi Anna:Who said?
Viboothi Anna:1 4 Weeks work != Research 2 I personally feel there is no need of research catogery
Viboothi Anna:And those are not relly researc project
Vishwaak Chandran:They can continue to work on them after the program
Viboothi Anna:Research Workflow is like - First mesure - Second Study - Third Experiment
Viboothi Anna:How do you classify something as research level?
Viboothi Anna:I am not sure
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Viboothi Anna:how did you guys even do that
Viboothi Anna:Are you even sure?
Vishwaak Chandran:To be honest no
Viboothi Anna:Then how can the amDeC even choose without even understanding Blindly
Viboothi Anna:Are you guys that much stupid?
Viboothi Anna:Did not expect to be like that
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay let me get it clarified and come back to you
Viboothi Anna:If you guys cannot classify a project as reserach/normal then I think you guys are not qualified to even host such an event
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay, anikeeth Anna wanted his ideas to be in a separate categories as research that was the sole reason why it was made into it.
Viboothi Anna:I wanted a seperate catogery in another catogery, so you guys will do that
Vishwaak Chandran:He said the his ideas needs to be build from the base
Vishwaak Chandran:If the ideas you give are good then yes
Vishwaak Chandran:The main reason why they were considered as research level projects as they are in there initial stage once they are constructed we will have to test them out then use then their result.
Vishwaak Chandran:Does that reason qualify for a research project?
Viboothi Anna:Not really
Viboothi Anna:Not at all
Vishwaak Chandran:
Viboothi Anna:If a project has this three elemnt of work then it would work I am not sure if those have that and time constrain is enough, and if those are really these. It depends on how you guys define, and in the amDeC CoC it wasn’t mentioned how to define a project as Research one. It clearly voilation of your own Code of Conduct bascially
Viboothi Anna:It is now odns instead of dns
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna let me summarize what you said, The research project are not research project. There is required time for completing the projects right?. Either move them to the category of projectvor remove them right?
Viboothi Anna:IT depends on you guys
Viboothi Anna:its your club, you guys decide
Viboothi Anna:I am no one to give decisions
Viboothi Anna:I am just saying, please don’t make the club name ruin if you guys do on your own that is it
Vishwaak Chandran:Its everyone's club Anna.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna I get it.
Viboothi Anna:Next time onwards, please do research what you guys are doing, and proceed. It doesn’t matter who says, just see if it is valid, if I say it doesn’t mean I am right/wrong. You should understand what you are doing.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna from next time onwards we will, validate every idea given to us before proceeding.
Viboothi Anna:You have have a clear differntiating and understanding whether a project is a research one, fun one, side one, normal one. I honestly feel you guys don’t know those and blindly does it
Vishwaak Chandran:Btw can I ask this in the amdec thing?
Viboothi Anna:you are not getting any $$$
Viboothi Anna:Did he submit mentor form?
Vishwaak Chandran:I don't think, so
Viboothi Anna:Then how can you even have it there at first place
Viboothi Anna:is there any way you can bypass those very basic things?
Vishwaak Chandran:Why? It's internal projects + external projects
Viboothi Anna:Since, Internal projects are asked via Google Forms
Viboothi Anna:and set of questions should be answered
Viboothi Anna:I did not see any applicaiton and review process did not go
Viboothi Anna:and you did classify few external prjects as not fit and rejected while this was getting Wild Card
Viboothi Anna:This is ridiculous.
Vishwaak Chandran:We were biased that's the thing right?
Viboothi Anna:I am fine with anyone submitting and having it there, but without any basic metric, but voilating your own rules and all, is the whole point
Viboothi Anna:I did not submit because I did not get itme, and deadline was done. So did not go.
Viboothi Anna:Not baised, bascailly you voilated all rules you guys made that is it and did not validate ideas before posting. If you guys did research about it then this would not be happening.
Viboothi Anna:I did not want or will not involve that is why I am asking you personally. one of my friend who is from a college in kochi mocked me and started questioning me how did you even classify small side one as research.
Viboothi Anna:I really felt offended and bad since it ruined club name in a big way
Viboothi Anna:due to carelessness of amDeC team
Viboothi Anna:I did say it was others and I wasn’t involved thus asking you
Vishwaak Chandran:It was a clear big mistake from our part for giving someone free entry into the projects. The rules had to same for everyone. In the process we did violate our coc. From now on we will take care of each and every decision we take and also make sure that it doesn't have impact on the clubs name and so it's members in any bad manner . We really, sorry for this stupid mistake. This matter will be discussed in the group and a quick decision will be take to either rename the idea or move the ideas to the project section.
Viboothi Anna:I would suggest to remove them
Viboothi Anna:It's personal as those are not fit, Let the reviewers atleast review those are very basic thing you can do
Viboothi Anna:If there are no reviewer, me, Siddarth Krishan are free
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna we will, assemble a review team on them asap.
Viboothi Anna:And we would also require to submit in the way how everyone is submitting
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna
Viboothi Anna:Let you guys only review
Viboothi Anna:Don't propose our name at first
Viboothi Anna:P please edit or remove
Viboothi Anna:ASAP
Viboothi Anna:I would also like to see how you guys review it
Vishwaak Chandran:okay anna
Viboothi Anna:So you can improve
Vishwaak Chandran:This paper is on Dns and the idea of anikeeth anna is on ODN both of them are different.
Viboothi Anna:Yes
Viboothi Anna:I did mention
Viboothi Anna:!
Viboothi Anna:Read what I have mentioned properly
Vishwaak Chandran:Both are different techs.
Viboothi Anna:Not really
Viboothi Anna:Odns is extension of dbs
Viboothi Anna:DNS
Viboothi Anna:Infavour of privacy
Viboothi Anna:That's what I understood
Viboothi Anna:Odns comes with privacy, So basically we are using odns and do the Verbatim of the paper.
Vishwaak Chandran:The paper you sent me is acuatlly talking about the security aspects of the protocol. So i think It's going to be the same experiement on two different protocol.
Viboothi Anna:Yeah, So he should fill mentor form to get to know about project ans our gain
Vishwaak Chandran:He said no for the form.
Viboothi Anna:Why?
Vishwaak Chandran:No time
Viboothi Anna:Then no project in amDeC
Vishwaak Chandran:If the goals of the project cannot be specified then i will have to take it down
Viboothi Anna:Then idk how he can mentor
Vishwaak Chandran:How can i ask him? if he has no time to fill a form how can he mentor ?
Viboothi Anna:Without review,it should not be posted
Vishwaak Chandran:Like maybe 30, 20, 10. For. Prize money?
Viboothi Anna:Works
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna, The following message is a update for the vidyut hackathon . So we make a telegram group and discussed stuff there . Out of the discussion these were the things which were decided. 1) there will be themes provided for all the participants they select the theme they need to work on. 2) yash said he can get the github sponsorship. 3) prize money is 30k, 20k, 10k 4) harckathon shares the same theme as vidyuth. 5) we decide have a 24 or 36 hour hackathon.
Viboothi Anna:Vidyut
Viboothi Anna:Not vidyuth
Viboothi Anna:We are mostly not going to do if we are jot going to get any profit
Vishwaak Chandran:I fear we might not get any profit
Viboothi Anna:Then don't
Viboothi Anna:We cannot burn 50k INR
Vishwaak Chandran:Shall we drop it?
Viboothi Anna:Simply for PR
Viboothi Anna:Confirm this first
Vishwaak Chandran:It's gonna cost more
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Taking these points into consideration - target crowd is jobless people coming to college not for learning but for having fun - its a hackathon. what hackathon fetches you money? hackathons are done hand in hand with companies who want some problem to be solved. -Only thing we will gain is going to be PR. -During this period productivity of the club will also reduce. Shall we drop the thing?
Viboothi Anna:Ol

Gopika:Yes I did
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello everyone, During the period of periodicals, there is no requirement of status update and also I noticed that during the preparation days every day there was a message popping stating they won't be coming to the lab. It's totally fine to take time off to prepare for periodicals but instead of spamming the group on a regular message just put a single message stating you won't come to the lab for a given specified period.
Vishwaak Chandran:.
Gopika:Idk why did she send today
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:Lol it's fine if she sends tomorrow just remind her why we do a status update.

Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:How long is the project?
Gopika:Its not a big one...its just a small flutter application
Gopika:The app shld basically scan an object n tell whether its recyclable or not
Vishwaak Chandran:How do you plan on finding whether the object is recyclable or not?
Gopika:Tensorflow has tht object detction thing right...with tht object can be identified but then have to identify whether its recyclable or not after tht
Gopika:Need to figure this
Vishwaak Chandran:Don't get me wrong if you know what object it is then isn't it a matter of a if statement to say it's recyclable or not .
Gopika:I
Gopika:Just doing it to learn things thts it
Vishwaak Chandran:Lol

Vishwaak Chandran:Take a look into the calender in cms.
Vishwaak Chandran:The month of February will do ig
Gopika:Ig we have to keep it as soon as possible...so Im thinking to keep it on jan itself
Gopika:They r busy all the time

Vishwaak Chandran:Let me see if I can get a date in January
Vishwaak Chandran:Btw how long is the talk going to be?

Vishwaak Chandran:Okay let me see.. Will get back to you in 10 mins
Gopika:Ohk
Vishwaak Chandran:Hey
Vishwaak Chandran:I saw the dates i think it woulb be better if we can have it on Dec 19 since Dec 20 we have only AVP exam.
Vishwaak Chandran:Will that work ?
Gopika:Dec ?
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:*jan
Vishwaak Chandran:
Gopika:Ok so jan 19 is a sun ?

Gopika:Its fine...but will everyone come
Vishwaak Chandran:Kiddo check the calender it's a sunday : )
Gopika:It shld be fine for everyone
Vishwaak Chandran:Assuming or are you sure ?
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:
Gopika:It shld be fine for everyone...otherwise there is no point in keeping the talk and idk whether it will be fine for everyone
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Should we ask the people in the offical group or before that ask the 2nd years?
Gopika:Only 2nd yrs r having xams during tht time ?
Vishwaak Chandran:I don't think so third years might also have a exam during that time.
Vishwaak Chandran:I asked the third years said that they are fine with it.
Gopika:Oh ok
Vishwaak Chandran:So shall we fix the date?
Gopika:Yep
Vishwaak Chandran:When are you planning to inform the couples?
Gopika:They asked me to inform them atleast bfore a week..so ig I'll inform them nxt week once I come to college
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay do we need to do a pole to know the number of people will be coming? We should also let sir know about the date and ask him where is the talk supposed to happen and also about their travel and stuff.
Gopika:I think its better to talk to sir once abt it...so thought of talking to him next week and then will fix the date and inform them
Gopika:Is tht fine ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah that's a better idea . We shall follow that then.
Vishwaak Chandran:Should I remind you about it after college reopens?
Gopika:Ohk
Gopika:No
Gopika:Ig my memory power is not tht
Vishwaak Chandran:I hope so it's not : )
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:Btw how was your day ?
Gopika:It was gud ig :)
Vishwaak Chandran:You can't guess stuff like this
Gopika:Ya
Gopika:Well...it was not so gud
Vishwaak Chandran:What happened?
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you fight with someone?
Gopika:Idk...my mood is not gud today
Gopika:Im sad tht first day of this year was like
Gopika:Not really
Vishwaak Chandran:It happens a quite a lot with me though.
Vishwaak Chandran:You can't help it can you ?Every day is a new day.
Gopika:I knw I cant help it
Gopika:Every day is new but tht doesnt mean tht I can erase evrytng tht had happened in the past
Vishwaak Chandran:It's true though but the things of past should not affect your present.
Vishwaak Chandran:If that's the case it will just predefined what will happen in future it takes out the surprise element in life.
Gopika:I really wish tht it doesnt affect...but wht to do, things r not really happening according to my wish lol
Vishwaak Chandran:True thou most of things don't happen in the way we want but still taking out the positivity out from them is the key to happiness.
Gopika:Ya I knw...but wht of there is positivity at all
Gopika:Wht shld I take then ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Then just take it as learning experience and most of them tend to have a positivety which we lack to see.
Gopika:Exactly..thts all I can do, learn sntng frm all these
Gopika:And thts exactly wht Im doing now
Gopika:Ohh god wht r we
Vishwaak Chandran:That's the better of those things we can do tbh.
Vishwaak Chandran:Aha it's always interesting to talk which tends to deal with our everyday life.
Gopika:
Gopika:I sound like a super pessimist smtimes if u talk to
Vishwaak Chandran:It's fine. Darkness needs light and so does light.
Gopika:Ya :)
Vishwaak Chandran:It's fine to be pessimist sometimes rather than being optimistic because some situations needs us to be.
Gopika:Ya..its fine sometimes but not always
Gopika:And I'll smtimes bring lot of negativity into me which really worsen things most of the time
Vishwaak Chandran:I would rather say negativity is another aspects of the situation which most people lack to see.
Vishwaak Chandran:It, plays a more important role in planning.
Gopika:Ya I agree...seeing negative side of a situation really helps in planning
Gopika:But always seeing negativity and bringing tht into u is not very gud...infact it will take away ur confidence
Gopika:I have experienced it a lot
Vishwaak Chandran:The moment you feel that it's taking away you confidence its the point you need to switch way of thinking.
Vishwaak Chandran:Everytime I think of a situation I end up thinking of all possible out come I start with the negative one and end with positive ones to make sure I don't get a hit
Vishwaak Chandran:But switching is really hard tbh .
Gopika:Exactly...thts the problem
Gopika:And nowadays Im trying to figure out my
Gopika:Im not understanding
Vishwaak Chandran:I guess your in the that stage of life were your about to escape your vicious cycle of birth and rebirth
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:Just note down how you react to stuff it should help you out. It's not bad if you have multiple behaviors
Gopika:Its really hard to live here tbh
Vishwaak Chandran:Here emplies?
Gopika:I always tell to venu ettan tht I want to shift to
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:Live among the penguin
Vishwaak Chandran:Not a bad idea
Gopika:Yes...it will be fun
Gopika:And the thing I like the most abt it is tht there wont be any human beings there
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:Why don't you try going on trips? It helps in introspection most times.
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:Human beings are not that bad. It feels good sometimes to vent out to people.
Gopika:Mm ya
Gopika:I didnt say they r bad...I dont blame anyone too
Gopika:I blame myself...I maynot be able to deal wd ppl or wd the situations properly
Gopika:Thts why Im having difficulty in living
Vishwaak Chandran:I understand your point. But those things comes with experience right?
Gopika:Exactly...and I think I have some experience and tht makes me say this
Vishwaak Chandran:I feel the way you deal with people is your way(Gopika way) unique there is no better or worse ways in dealing people
Vishwaak Chandran:Do you have a big friends circle or a small one?
Gopika:Well not a very big frnds circle...but ya I have quite a lot of them
Vishwaak Chandran:It's the first place from where you learn to deal with people it's a safe ground to start with
Gopika:Ya
Gopika:And u might have noticed tht I dont talk much to ppl
Gopika:Its a bit difficult for me to go n start a conversation wd anyone...
Gopika:But once Im comfortable wd someone I'll talk to them normally
Vishwaak Chandran:I though that's because your chossy .
Gopika:I am...its hard for me to get comfortable wd ppl
Gopika:But once I get comfortable I think I'll talk normally
Vishwaak Chandran:Talking to someone is hard sometimes when you don't share anything in common.
Vishwaak Chandran:What I usually tend to do is talk random topic to this person keep on pivoting till I find a topic to share on.
Gopika:Ya...but at the same time its interesting smtimes to talk to a person when both doesnt have nothing in
Vishwaak Chandran:Most of the times it tends out to be awkward conversation
Vishwaak Chandran:And I am really bad at it
Gopika:Ya...but thts fun
Vishwaak Chandran:Sometimes else you might reach a dead end.
Vishwaak Chandran:No way to proceed future
Gopika:When u reach the dead end just stop the
Vishwaak Chandran:That what happens most of the time to my conversation
Gopika:
Gopika:Same wd me
Gopika:Im really bad at talking to ppl
Vishwaak Chandran:I don't think so...
Vishwaak Chandran:See your taking to me..
Gopika:I'll remain silent unless the other person comes up wd a
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:I used to wait for the person to come and talk to me but sometimes it doesn't happen so i am like just pick some random topic go and talk.
Gopika:Even I do the same...I wait for a person to come n talk to me
Gopika:But thts not so gud...I cant expect everyone to come n talk to me evrytime
Vishwaak Chandran:But at the same time I make sure that I don't annoy the person. If I feel even in the slight I do annoy them. I just distance out.
Vishwaak Chandran:That's true when you need someone to talk it's gonna need some effort.
Gopika:Ya...Im scared of tht, I dont understand smtimea tht if Im annoying tht persob or not
Gopika:And thts one of the reason Im scared to talk to ppl most of the time...I feel tht Im really annoying
Vishwaak Chandran:Lol even i am confused most of time and eventually lose track of my conversation
Vishwaak Chandran:This annoying thing is really hard to find out in chats at, least in real life with their expression you, make out.
Gopika:
Gopika:Exactly....and most of the time I'll be confused coz of this thing
Vishwaak Chandran:We need to figure out a way to figure this out.
Gopika:Ya...we have
Vishwaak Chandran:But sometimes its fun to annoy people.
Gopika:Ya...uts fun to annoy ppl whom we r close to
Gopika:I deliberately annoy sm ppl like all the time....theyll be my frmds and I will be comfortable enough wd them to do tht
Gopika:But idk if I annoy someone unknowingly when I talk to them...and thts wht Im scared of
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah mainly best friends and family members .
Gopika:Yess
Vishwaak Chandran:I am scared of this thing the most because annoying someone unknowly is really bad.
Gopika:Yes exactly
Gopika:I think I have to do it
Vishwaak Chandran:seems like we tends to share something in common
Gopika:Yes
Gopika:So dont have to worry abt our conversation reaching a dead end
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah so do I anymore
Gopika:
Vishwaak Chandran:Anyway it was nice talking to you : ) Good night and take care.
Vishwaak Chandran:We started with something and ended with something

Vamshi Krishna C:Anna should I include in status update about the stuff I learned about git
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes be more brief .
Vamshi Krishna C:anna
Vamshi Krishna C:I did some research about the git commands I am using
Vishwaak Chandran:okay so what did you figure out?
Vamshi Krishna C:I understood that, git add is used for including what will be committed. git commit is used to save changes in a local git repository. (and -m is an option where we set a message for the change made). git push is used to transfer the commits to a remote repository. I also learned that, local git repository is one that is in our pc while remote repository is where the code is published online and that's what everyone sees.
Vishwaak Chandran:okay
Vishwaak Chandran:do inlcude that in your status update
Vamshi Krishna C:tomorrow's?
Vamshi Krishna C:nvm
Kasthuri:Hi chetta

Vishwaak Chandran:You replied to yesterdays and to today's thread.
Kasthuri:Yaa. I just woke up and send the message. I didn't check which thread it was.
Kasthuri:Sorry for the late reply, I was sleeping Chetta.
Vishwaak Chandran:Next time make sure such trivial mistakes don't happen.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta. So sorry for that
Kasthuri:Chetta. I am sorry. I didn't get time to send a separate mail for you and Shivangi Chechi as I reached home late and also want to get up early tomorrow. On Monday I am having a lab exam ( end SEM ) , so I don't think that I can send a separate mail tomorrow too. I will try to send the separate mail after Monday with detailed explanation of what all I did. I have tried to make my status update more descriptive nowadays. Please tell me if I need to improve it.
Vishwaak Chandran:Take care of your health first then you can send status updates. Once you get well compile all the work done in a single thread and send it.
Kasthuri:I have just started to do the work properly. Will surely send it. And I am fine now
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good to hear.
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the status with Gatsby setup?
Vishwaak Chandran:How long are you planning to learn from the website?
Kasthuri:May be for two more days.
Vishwaak Chandran:After that?
Kasthuri:Shivangi chechi asked me to create a blog post using gatsby site. Will try to do it.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay cool. I would like you to complete the blog by this Sunday.
Kasthuri:I will try my level best to complete it chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:If your not able to sent a spectate status update. Then don't CC the regular status update thread.
Kasthuri:Okay chetta
Kasthuri:I am sorry for that
Kasthuri:I didn't know that we are not supposed to do it
Kasthuri:Won't repeat it chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:See the main reason why we wanted you do a separate status update is because we wanted you to explain the stuff more deeply in a regular basis. So that you'll get a better understanding of things.
Kasthuri:I am really sorry for that.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the status with Gatsby blog?
Kasthuri:I am doing the css part with module css. But it is having errors.
Vishwaak Chandran:What kind of error?
Kasthuri:Chetta I have class now will tell you about the error in detail after 3:30
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay fine
Kasthuri:
Kasthuri:It is not working
Vishwaak Chandran:It's just a warning
Vishwaak Chandran:It can be ignored.
Kasthuri:But then the site is not coming
Vishwaak Chandran:The builds successful
Vishwaak Chandran:Check if there is any error in your code.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:Working on it
Vishwaak Chandran:What exactly did you do?.
Kasthuri:Actually what I did was I took an example they took. Was making modifications in that. I couldn't learn the syntax they have used properly. It is not pure JavaScript or pure css it is something else JSX ( react )
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay that's fine. Check manually if your able to call the page.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you localhost the page?
Kasthuri:That is what happens when I use the develop command right
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you do Gatsby serve?
Kasthuri:No
Vishwaak Chandran:Try it out
Kasthuri:Yes cheta
Kasthuri:Chetta I think it's the error with my code. Let check it once again and will tell you
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay .
Vishwaak Chandran:Do let me know in the earliest.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:I sincerely apologize for not sending the status on my blog. I had an end sem exam today and had a lot to write. I was asked to create a blog using gatsby on 4 th of november. Soon after that I got fever and was not able to work. And after one week I started to work again and learnt a bit of JSX syntax and react. Since the deadline was on sunday I was not able to learn more and also I had two lab exams on the same week and assignments to complete. I modified an example they provided and tried to run the code. But then it had a lot of issues. I trued changing the code a bit and also tried gatsby serve command instead of gatsby develop command, But then the issue isn't solved yet. I humbly request you to extend the deadline so that I can work on it properly and create the blog by myself, since this week I have 2 exams and some assignments and from 26 th I have the End sem exams and I have to study for tha too. I will try to complete it asap.
Vishwaak Chandran:Timelines and deadlines are short goals which help you work better and to improve your work output if you have any problem with the dates do negotiate at that moment. Club is a space where you tend to find solution for the problems you find difficult to solve. At any point of time feel free to contact anyone part of club they would be most obliged to help you. Try mentioning about the problem in the mailing list someone will help you. I still don't understand why you didn't mention about the problem in the last two weeks. If you don't feel comfortable with the assigned mentor, do let the seniors knows they will help you out .
Kasthuri:I have always tried to make my mailing list more specific and detailed. But for the past two weeks I couldn't properly send the status updates. From next time will definitely mention the issues.
Vishwaak Chandran:But why, didn't you contact your mentor?
Kasthuri:Regarding the error part?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Kasthuri:I thought not to disturb her.
Vishwaak Chandran:Never think such stuff
Vishwaak Chandran:Mentors are supposed to disturbed.
Kasthuri:I know chetta it is my
Vishwaak Chandran:Don't make the same mistake twice.
Kasthuri:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:How's the end sem exams going?
Kasthuri:So difficult
Vishwaak Chandran:You will get used to it don't worry : )
Kasthuri:Ayyo it won't become easy aa??
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:At one point you will get used to it.
Kasthuri:Hmm
Kasthuri:They give a lot of assignments and lab record to write
Vishwaak Chandran:Only for the first year after that you will be free from record.
Vishwaak Chandran:Assignments will never end troubling.
Kasthuri:Anyways I usually copy from others..
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a better option.
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:How many more lab exams and when?
Kasthuri:Tomorrow I have missed periodical and on Thursday psat lab exam and after that from 26 th onwards theory exams till Dec 6 th
Vishwaak Chandran:Missed periodicals for which subject?
Kasthuri:Hardware essentials
Kasthuri:One credit course
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh, okay all the best

Vishwaak Chandran:Goodnight
Vishwaak Chandran:ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Vibhoothi Kasthuri Nair Athira Nair Shashank Akshay Nair Vishwaak Chandran This is reboot hackathon team. Are you okay with this team ?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta I am okay with it

Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:How's the blog going ?
Kasthuri:Chetta I restarted doing it. I am trying it with plugins.
Kasthuri:And Chetta one problem is that I don't know from where should I learn the syntax. As I think it is not pure JavaScript and react
Kasthuri:I am confused that should I learn the whole thing and do it should I just change the example that is given.
Vishwaak Chandran:Restarted doing the local setup or the tutorial you were watching ?
Kasthuri:Tutorial
Vishwaak Chandran:What were you trying to doing in the tutorial ?
Vishwaak Chandran:It depeands on the way you learn stuff, it would be better to start to learn the basics before you start with anything . During the due cource you might get idea's on which you can work on.
Kasthuri:Okayy
Kasthuri:And tbh this is boring
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah ik. Do you have something else in mind ?
Kasthuri:I thought this would be nice but then now I am so confused about what should I learn and should I learn pure JavaScript or react thing, like all the sites gives different syntax and all. I am thinking of learning kotlin
Vishwaak Chandran:It would be better if you start with learning React from basics and then start with a project.
Vishwaak Chandran:This website is pretty good with content and the teaching style it should help you in progressing. Try it out and let me know.
Vishwaak Chandran:If you want to work with gatsby then it easy if you start with react and then move forward to gatsby.
Kasthuri:Okay chetta
Kasthuri:Thank you
Kasthuri:I will see it and let you know.
Vishwaak Chandran:When did you reach home ?
Kasthuri:Yesterday
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay take some rest before you start working on anything.
Kasthuri:Okay Chetta but then actually I took rest
Kasthuri:I reached home early yesterday
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:And also try selecting a GSoC org
Kasthuri:Was not able to open the site chetta
Kasthuri:Yes chetta I will definitely do this
Kasthuri:If we can't finish everything given in the bucket list then what happens chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:We don't want you to complete everything in the bucket list just have a set of 5 tasks or more. It's just a compliment to the club activites you do.
Vishwaak Chandran:It also tends to give you the postive vibe that sir wants to share with everyone in the club. The things mentioned in the bucket list are the other skills other than your technical skills.
Kasthuri:5 tasks or more of the non technical tasks right.
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Kasthuri:Should I include the non technical stuff also in the mail??
Kasthuri:The mail about the plan for vacation?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah that would be good.
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah
Kasthuri:Chetta should my mail be more descriptive and should i add more topics in Technical stuff
Kasthuri:??
Vishwaak Chandran:Add as much you can do. Just don't over do stuff. Give a short para of 3-4 lines nothing more than that.
Kasthuri:Chetta I already send one can u check it and tell me what all I need to add when u get time?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah will look into it and will let you know by the morning.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:Chetta I am not able to do it today as I am in my relatives house and my lap is not free at all. I will do it tomorrow.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Do you have time to select a GSoC org ?
Kasthuri:I selected one
Kasthuri:I gave it in the sheet
Vishwaak Chandran:Which one did you select ?
Vishwaak Chandran:And why ?
Kasthuri:I selected zulip because it was given the main focus areas as HTML css , visual design and mobile development. At least I could understand something that was written in that or else I think of Mozilla too but then I am not sure of it
Kasthuri:And Chetta they haven't announced the ideas till now right
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you take a look into the current projects ? Did you find something in that ?
Vishwaak Chandran:It's usually these projects get a feature implemented during the GSoC period . The idea are also based on it.
Kasthuri:Ohh okayy
Kasthuri:It is written that it doesn't have any current ideas but then after that they have given some ideas
Vishwaak Chandran:It takes time for organisation to release the idea statement.
Kasthuri:Hmm
Kasthuri:So can I finalize that chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:But did you take a look into the existing project in zullip?
Kasthuri:Looking
Kasthuri:Cheta I did send u the updated mail
Vishwaak Chandran:I haven't received any mails
Kasthuri:Ayyoo
Vishwaak Chandran:When did you send?
Kasthuri:Yesterday
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah I got the email
Kasthuri:okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Watching cs50 and learning a other language is not necessary
Vishwaak Chandran:You can use the time for better things
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you start with react?
Kasthuri:Thanks chetta since cs50 was in the bucket list I thought of doing it but then other language was my on my wish and I don't think I would get time for that.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta I started it today.
Vishwaak Chandran:Just make sure you mange your time effectively
Kasthuri:CS50 is actually very boring
Kasthuri:And chetta I am thinking to make a website for weather forecasting?
Vishwaak Chandran:If you use this holidays to learn react properly then there are lot projects you can contribute to
Kasthuri:How about it
Kasthuri:Yes chetta I will
Vishwaak Chandran:What are the features it?
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a very common idea
Kasthuri:That I know
Kasthuri:But then I just have the idea I haven't decided what to do actually.
Vishwaak Chandran:Don't rush on a project idea just take two days time and decide on something interesting
Vishwaak Chandran:Something you can use on a day to day basis.
Kasthuri:Okay chettaa.. first I thought I can make apps using react then after that I understood that react native and react are both different stuffs
Kasthuri:Okay chetta I will think on it.
Vishwaak Chandran:They sound the same but are entirely different things
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Just keep it in behind your mind so that a idea might pop out anytime.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good : )
Kasthuri:Good night chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Good morning for me
Vishwaak Chandran:Anyway goodnight
Kasthuri:y
Kasthuri:good morning
Vishwaak Chandran:This is the most productive time
Kasthuri:ohh thats true but then my mom won't allow me to stay awake now
Vishwaak Chandran:If it's home it's a different scenario
Vishwaak Chandran:Then better sleep.
Kasthuri:yaa
Kasthuri:bye chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Bye
Kasthuri:Hello chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello
Kasthuri:Chetta is boost a good organisation??
Vishwaak Chandran:It's good but lot of math
Kasthuri:Can I change to that organisation??
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you take a look into previous year projects?
Kasthuri:I am looking it chetta
Kasthuri:I think its based on image processing
Vishwaak Chandran:And based on what criteria did you select?
Kasthuri:C++
Vishwaak Chandran:And then what else?
Kasthuri:Because I think I know C++ much better, and it had image processing as well and I thought I will learn it
Vishwaak Chandran:See the thing with boost is it requires you to implement algorithms for image processing and the thing is they need to optimized as much as possible. So I feel right now it might be a very difficult org
Kasthuri:Okayy chetta
Kasthuri:This is really confusing
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a common feeling for everyone.
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the matter with zullip?
Kasthuri:Nothing
Kasthuri:Like no one has chosen zulip and I think it's the backup organisation Swathi chechi took
Kasthuri:So I was just thinking
Vishwaak Chandran:Aha that's the matter
Vishwaak Chandran:See okay let me tell you something it doesn't matter what other people pick it never matters to anyone here. Last year I took a organization called moving blocks and none of the people in the past had taken it . But when you get to be first in the community it's a totally a new experience and worth it. The main thing why we guys want you people to Do GSoC is to experience the fun of the contributing and to give the ability to read a larger code base.
Vishwaak Chandran:And don't confuse your pick for something trivial like this.
Kasthuri:Okay chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you go through any of the projects in zullip?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Did something interest you ?
Kasthuri:Yaa
Kasthuri:One terminal thing
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try building it locally?
Kasthuri:Ayyo no
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay it's fine.
Vishwaak Chandran:Just try building it locally and fix some small bugs
Vishwaak Chandran:Shouldn't you be sleeping?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:My sister video called so we both were talking...
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh okay.
Kasthuri:Good morning chettaa....
Vishwaak Chandran:Good night
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try to finalize a org ?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:I would like to go with zulip itself
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you select a sub project in it?
Kasthuri:I was going through the issues in github
Kasthuri:Noo
Kasthuri:Chetta it is like after we select issues and then merge prs to it right
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes we first claim a issue in github and then work on it. Then we send a patch which fixes the issue then the reviewer reviews the code . Once the code is good enough then they merge it.( merging it is called as merged PR)
Kasthuri:Okayy chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Before that make sure that you setup the local development environment
Vishwaak Chandran:Btw, Why has there been no status update from you in the last one month ?
Kasthuri:After coming home I was a bit busy last week. Before that I had exams.
Vishwaak Chandran:Next time make sure something like this does not happen.
Kasthuri:Sure chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Try sending the update through phone(not recommend) even if no work is done.
Vishwaak Chandran:When do you plan on building the local devlopment environment ?
Kasthuri:Today
Kasthuri:Will try
Vishwaak Chandran:Good.
Vishwaak Chandran:If you hit any blockers let me know in the earliest
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:How is it going ?
Kasthuri:It's fine chetta
Kasthuri:But then I am not understanding what I am doing so I am trying to understand that first
Vishwaak Chandran:Which part ?
Kasthuri:Starting itself . But Chetta I will try and find out by myself. And Chetta I didn't get any idea for the project so can I start with the weather forecasting one for now as a beginner and I think while working on it I will get ideas for the other project??
Kasthuri:I was reading more about vagrant and docker thing
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay but you need to setup the local developement version of Zullip by the weekend and also need to start working on fixing small bugs.
Vishwaak Chandran:Do send your status update for the day
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:If I can't make it up today I will tell u tomorrow chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:That's fine.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:What happend to your Work Report ?
Kasthuri:Did it
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:How's the local environment setup going?
Kasthuri:Chetta I encountered with a public key error
Vishwaak Chandran:How long have you been struck with the problem?
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try to ask the people in IRC?
Kasthuri:Actually a lot
Kasthuri:No
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay join the IRC and the mailing list by tonight. Give them a proper introduction who you are And where your from.
Kasthuri:Okay chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Once your done let me know
Kasthuri:And Chetta I am having issues with using vagrant
Vishwaak Chandran:What is it ?
Kasthuri:First they asked to clone their repo using git clone --config pull.rebase git command and when I used it there was public key error and after that i understood that it was something related to SSH key authentication. So I just cloned the repo and then they asked to start the development environment by using vagrant and it is not working now.
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you follow the exact steps mentioned in the Doc?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:vagrant up --provider=docker
Vishwaak Chandran:After this step right ?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta after it was given use gem pristine ffi -- version 1.11.1
Kasthuri:So I did it
Vishwaak Chandran:Can you send a SS?
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:Dependence error
Kasthuri:What to do
Vishwaak Chandran:After installing nokogiri did you do a Vagrant up ?
Vishwaak Chandran:What was the result of that?
Kasthuri:yes
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:This should help you.
Vishwaak Chandran:Update me once your done. Even if it works or not.
Kasthuri:Yes chetta
Kasthuri:Chetta they doesn't have a mailing list active right now and I have entered into the IRC channel but then I don't understand how to begin with like what should I do with that which stream should I reply
Vishwaak Chandran:What are the streams?
Kasthuri:There are a lot like backend, frontend, check-ins, code review, design, desktop....
Kasthuri:I entered into the frontend steam
Vishwaak Chandran:There should be one for general
Vishwaak Chandran:Btw did this work?
Kasthuri:One all messages option was there
Kasthuri:It is still installing
Kasthuri:
Kasthuri:I think since it is the installation of virtual settings it will take a lot of time
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:Aha it might also depend on the internet speed
Kasthuri:Hmm
Vishwaak Chandran:How does this feel?
Kasthuri:It is slow here
Kasthuri:Painful
Vishwaak Chandran:Then it will take time.
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh
Vishwaak Chandran:I always felt cool when something like that happened : )
Kasthuri:Chetta last year did you get GSoC
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Vishwaak Chandran:But I did learn lot of things
Kasthuri:Hmm
Kasthuri:Motivation
Kasthuri:Is it because of the organisation you selected?
Vishwaak Chandran:I understood how to read a larger code base and without getting main part is without getting lost.
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Kasthuri:Hmm
Kasthuri:This organisation atleast gave the instructions to set up the development environment, my frnd was telling the organisation he selected had no such info
Vishwaak Chandran:Who?
Kasthuri:Ananthan
Vishwaak Chandran:What did he select?
Kasthuri:Gnome
Vishwaak Chandran:They would have a spectate documentation
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a big org with pretty good documentation
Kasthuri:But then he was telling he is going to change it as some bhayya told that there will be less no of web development projects for it
Kasthuri:Then y was he telling like
Vishwaak Chandran:Probably he didn't look into the proper documentation
Kasthuri:May be..
Vishwaak Chandran:If he had searched properly he would get the documentation
Kasthuri:Hmm
Vishwaak Chandran:What's your idea on GSoC?
Kasthuri:Meaning
Vishwaak Chandran:What do you think about GSoC?
Kasthuri:Platform for people with skills
Vishwaak Chandran:Then? What else?
Kasthuri:Where students get a chance to understand how working in a company feels like
Kasthuri:And Chetta did any chechi got GSoC last year?
Vishwaak Chandran:*company - organization
Vishwaak Chandran:Unfortunately no
Kasthuri:Yaa
Kasthuri:
Vishwaak Chandran:Don't worry we will change it this time.
Kasthuri:
Kasthuri:Ya ya sure
Vishwaak Chandran:That's all?
Kasthuri:Ya?
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay . There are lot more things to it. It helps you to understand how a real life project is been constructed and what a work flow is. You get to interact with so many unknown people which in turn build communication skills. Coming to your coding skills it makes it easy to understand the a larger code and you can rap around any large code base. And the best part is you get to gain lot more skills in a small time in a exponential rate. There is lot more to it only experience will let you taste it.
Kasthuri:Okay chetta. I wish if I could do it.
Vishwaak Chandran:It's doesn't matter whether you get it or not all that matters is the journey. The entire journey is a new experience.
Kasthuri:Chetta I didn't tell anything in the channel. Should I do it?
Kasthuri:Yaa I am understanding it.
Vishwaak Chandran:In the front-end channel?
Kasthuri:Yaa

Vishwaak Chandran:What's the popular sampling for analog to digital conversion?
Krishnan Iyer:Tell me frequency of your analog wave
Vishwaak Chandran:It's just a question
Vishwaak Chandran:In a crossword by ericson
Krishnan Iyer:ohk so it usually it should be like fs >= 2*f
Krishnan Iyer:fs -> sampling frequency
Vishwaak Chandran:It's just a name ig.
Krishnan Iyer:f -> frequency of the signal you want to sample
Krishnan Iyer:get me full question
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay 2 mins.

Vishwaak Chandran:It doesn't fit
Krishnan Iyer:yup
Vishwaak Chandran:That's why even google couldn't figure it out.
Krishnan Iyer:for 2nd one

Krishnan Iyer:you need to find something related to that
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay understood.
Krishnan Iyer:hey
Vishwaak Chandran:yes
Krishnan Iyer:just see if "similarity" works
Vishwaak Chandran:the shortest distance between two points is Euclidean distance

Vishwaak Chandran:We didn't cross validate the ideas did we?
Sai Rajendra Immadi:Nope
Vishwaak Chandran:What about the mentor form?
Vishwaak Chandran:Did he submit?
Sai Rajendra Immadi:He shared the ideas. As none of those had a base codebase he told that we could have a separate section named "research projects" and he'll mentor if anyone is interested.
Vishwaak Chandran:I found some projects online which are exactly the same
Sai Rajendra Immadi:Ohh..
Sai Rajendra Immadi:I didn't know that
Sai Rajendra Immadi:What can we do?
Vishwaak Chandran:But isn't this a clear violation of our own coc?
Sai Rajendra Immadi:Yeah it is
Vishwaak Chandran:Can we change the title of them from research projects to something else?

Sai Rajendra Immadi:Yeah we can change..
Vishwaak Chandran:Do discuss in the group and change it asap Anna

Mayukh Deb:Is it okay if my captcha reading program is made to work on mental math website(s) ? Because I'm not getting the right resources to really test it except a few pictures of math questions I downloaded
Mayukh Deb:Code will be up soon Can do all the 4 basic operations
Vishwaak Chandran:That's totally fine.
Mayukh Deb:keep the cursor on the left upper corner and press enter the move it to the lower right corner and press enter again and hopefully it'll work
Vishwaak Chandran:You always like to do some extra work. Will test it out and get back to you.
Mayukh Deb:Okay sure Tell me how can I improve it/ fix any errors
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah sure.
Vishwaak Chandran:It seams like i don't have the windll lib. It was a simple question why make it complicated , keep with the good work.
Mayukh Deb:I just wanted to make it a bit more realistic so that it can really detect digits from the website/browser window, and not just from a simple picture. The point is that I wanted to learn stuff while going a little beyond the question. Thanks for the insight !
Vishwaak Chandran:That's really the way everythig should be learned. It's good that your trying to genaralize the solution for each question.
Mayukh Deb:Yes, that was more or less my objective Thanks for the feedback ! Will keep you updated with the other tasks as well
Vishwaak Chandran:Good luck with the remaining tasks.
Mayukh Deb:Sure thing
Vishwaak Chandran:How are you uploading the code to github through terminal or browser?
Mayukh Deb:I didn't install git on Ubuntu yet
Mayukh Deb:So it's just browser for now But I'll install git as soon as possible, probably today
Mayukh Deb:I screwed up badly in ubuntu, and now my terminal isn't working Normally, Something to do with me installing python 3.7 maybe I've Been googling and trying to fix it all day yesterday, nothing worked. I think I have to fully install Ubuntu from a USB again right ?
Vishwaak Chandran:What exactly happened to your terminal ? Re-installing the os should be your last resort. Try fixing it you might come to know something new.
Mayukh Deb:My mistake was that I didn't know that Ubuntu has stuff running in the default python3 I installed 3.7 and just casually removed the 3.5 That's where I messed up
Mayukh Deb:I'm already making a live USB Hopefully I'll be back up and running by the evening
Vishwaak Chandran:Why are you installing python 3.7? That's right you messed up the package system of Ubuntu.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hello
Vishwaak Chandran:.
Mayukh Deb:Im almost done with the CLI app
Mayukh Deb:Reinstalled ubuntu Had a backup
Vishwaak Chandran:Status updates through email .
Mayukh Deb:Yes, I'll update today
Vishwaak Chandran:Why did you try to install python 3.7 ?
Mayukh Deb:Because I had 3.7 in windows and I Didn't really know what was different in 3.5 Also, I wasn't able to import some stuff in jupyter notebook for a long kind of an error And the solution was to reinstall a later version of python
Vishwaak Chandran:What kind of error was it a package error or an environment error ?
Mayukh Deb:Was actually a long error which led down to Module named <Xyz> does not exist The general "could not import module xyz error"
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you check if the module was installed in that env ?
Mayukh Deb:No I'll have to Google and learn a bit more of this stuff soon enough
Vishwaak Chandran:Before you do stuff make sure you do proper research . Otherwise you will have a tough time.
Mayukh Deb:Yes of course, I will make sure of that
Vishwaak Chandran:Are all the coner cases covered ? What if i have a email " @ . "
Mayukh Deb:This isn't valid
Mayukh Deb:This isn't either
Mayukh Deb:I'll check for this one right now, I've already checked for "@."
Vishwaak Chandran:.
Mayukh Deb:I'm checking right now
Vishwaak Chandran:okay.
Mayukh Deb:Shows invalid
Mayukh Deb:This one's invalid as well
Vishwaak Chandran:It should be valid .
Mayukh Deb:It's got a " .in x suffix
Mayukh Deb:*".in"
Vishwaak Chandran:what about hotmail , yahoo
Mayukh Deb:.in is valid for email ?
Vishwaak Chandran:yes
Vishwaak Chandran:Try googling and find what are the valid email id's
Mayukh Deb:.com and .edu are considered valid in my code
Mayukh Deb:Must be a long list
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Mayukh Deb:And I see no common pattern in them for defining a general form
Vishwaak Chandran:The Question holds the answer to reduce the list of email id.
Mayukh Deb:The first part is fine, what do I do for the long list of valid suffixes ?
Vishwaak Chandran:.
Mayukh Deb:Regex But how do I tell it that ".@@" is not valid but ".in" is ? The only common pattern is ".<string>"
Mayukh Deb:For the suffix I mean
Mayukh Deb:I might check for alphabets
Mayukh Deb:I'll have a read right now
Mayukh Deb:I didn't get an email from that thread , others got it
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you join the mailing list?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes that's true. Did you check your trash folder?
Mayukh Deb:nope, nothing in the trash related to this
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay what's your email ID?
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you get status update of venuverdan?
Mayukh Deb:no, nothing as such, still refreshing
Vishwaak Chandran:Check if you still have the invite for the mailing list.
Mayukh Deb:okay, got a thread with Venu Vardhan and Anantha Nandanan
Vishwaak Chandran:Just reply to that.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the status with the tasks?
Mayukh Deb:installed crate regex today, will be done by tomorow
Mayukh Deb:could not do much as i had to go outside and I came back just now
Vishwaak Chandran:That's fine. What about the remaining tasks?.
Mayukh Deb:Will do as soon as I'm done with this task and get some time outside of studies and packing my bags
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:How many of the task are completed in total?
Mayukh Deb:7 tasks are fully complete
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good.
Vishwaak Chandran:What are the remaining ones?
Mayukh Deb:Advanced xor Get it using JavaScript CLI App using Golang (tried, not working) Rusted email ( trying ) CS50 Pong game Project euler(did a few of them, not all) Bandit
Vishwaak Chandran:Still facing issues with the rusted email task? You just need to find out the pattern in email ids and create a regex expression for it.
Mayukh Deb:I packing/travelling for the last 4 days, will complete this task asap now
Vishwaak Chandran:When will you reach the campus?
Mayukh Deb:I reached an hour back
Vishwaak Chandran:How's your projects going?
Mayukh Deb:I have older projects as well, buy they're done before I came to Amrita
Vishwaak Chandran:Before you start with a new project make sure you complete the remaining tasks. As they will expose you different things.
Mayukh Deb:That is what actually happened with this project, I got to know about web scraping from the Ruby task Then used it's python version in my project Will plan my days ahead accordingly then
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good. What are the resources are you depending upon to complete a certain project?
Mayukh Deb:Intense googling and learning from YouTube videos
Mayukh Deb:YouTube is my primary source
Vishwaak Chandran:Any particular channels?
Mayukh Deb:Not exactly, but there are many channels I've watched videos from
Vishwaak Chandran:Your Euro truck simulator is a awesome project. How did you manage to pull it off ? ( just curious)
Mayukh Deb:I didn't study for my JEE that's how I did it actually
Mayukh Deb:I don't take full credit for the project Back then I didn't know how to build CNNs from scratch So I had to use an already made visual classification CNN called "alexnet" made by some Russian guy But that was back in jan-feb 2019
Vishwaak Chandran:Even though you didn't build it from scratch but still still it's a good project. How did you get the idea? Some random video?
Mayukh Deb:No There was this video called - AI learns to play Mario (or some name like that, I don't exactly remember)
Mayukh Deb:I'm also planning to make an improved version of it which will use joystick input for smoother steering
Mayukh Deb:And take in RGB input
Vishwaak Chandran:How will that improve the models accuracy?
Mayukh Deb:Model might learn that Green is for grass Grey for roads
Mayukh Deb:And it's objective is to stay in the road
Mayukh Deb:*on the road
Mayukh Deb:I have a list of possible improvements I have planned, lemme look for it
Mayukh Deb:My github repo is a mess for that project
Mayukh Deb:I have to clean it up a bit as well I guess
Mayukh Deb:Wait Wait , also uploading a readme I made long back
Vishwaak Chandran:That's fine. You can always improve the project you made but before you proceed with anything make sure you have your basics right.
Mayukh Deb:Which is why I'm learning pyTorch That's why I made the recent project, to apply what I've learned in pyTorch so far And to learn more about web scraping
Vishwaak Chandran:Keep that going and make sure you drop me a email regarding what you have done during the day.
Mayukh Deb:Readme is up btw
Vishwaak Chandran:Pytorch is a really a very good library but why not tensorflow?
Vishwaak Chandran:Will take a look into it.
Mayukh Deb:I tried to learn tensorflow, sis the basics like the Titanic datatsets etc, but then I had to quit this whole thing because of my JEE exams And I started after JEE again, with pyTorch There's not particular reason as to why I chose pyTorch
Mayukh Deb:*did the basics
Mayukh Deb:It's written way back, and I've learnt a little bit more since then
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay make sure you stick on to a one single library until you get the complete grip of it.
Mayukh Deb:Sticking to pyTorch
Vishwaak Chandran:Make sure you complete the task assp.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the final standing with tasks?
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the matter with rusted email?
Mayukh Deb:Could've done, but I'm drowning in assignments
Mayukh Deb:I have to submit a lot within the next 3 days
Vishwaak Chandran:That's lot of pending tasks.
Mayukh Deb:Should've invested more time
Vishwaak Chandran:Try completing 5,6,7 they, should be a breeze for you.
Mayukh Deb:I really want to do them as well But these assignments are killing me
Vishwaak Chandran:And upload the code even if it's not working.
Mayukh Deb:I lost all hope of doing more tasks thanks to my assignments So I've already sent the email
Vishwaak Chandran:See to get you, into the club the tasks are very much importance if you are not able to complete them in stimulated time it will, be t be a very tough call for me.
Vishwaak Chandran:Do take your time for your assignment as academic are more important right now concentrate on that.
Vishwaak Chandran:Once you get the time spend more time on these task rather than your personal projects.
Mayukh Deb:it's a rule I guess, I get the point. I will try my best, will upload at least one I actually was trying the go task long back, but faced long environment errors Adding to the fact that I was not at all familiar with the language, I got frustrated and left it and started with my project instead
Vishwaak Chandran:See the thing why we are trying to introduce these many languages is that, when your stuck on a problem you either google about the problem or ask your mentor. Feel free to ask me those ideas either I will solve your problem or will direct you to a person to someone who can solve the problem. One more important thing is you need not be familiar with that language you just need to get things required for that task and get it done.
Mayukh Deb:I'll complete at least one task pretty soon
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay good.
Mayukh Deb:it works through this error Incorrect Usage: flag provided but not defined: -pe
Mayukh Deb:the "-pe" part can be "-<anything>"
Mayukh Deb:
Mayukh Deb:will this do ?, if not then I'll work on it after dinner
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vishwaak Chandran:Weren't you supposed to use twitter api?
Mayukh Deb:I'm making the basic thing now
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try to google the error?
Mayukh Deb:It's dinner time, will Google after dinner
Vishwaak Chandran:It looks like a declaration error go through the code once again.
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Mayukh Deb:I'm done with most of the tasks CS50, and advanced XOR are the main ones left and some test cases in project Euler Working on pong game, will be done soon
Vishwaak Chandran:Why happened to your rust task ? Did you complete it?
Mayukh Deb:Used crate regex this time Not string management like I did before
Vishwaak Chandran:Is it updated in your github?
Mayukh Deb:Yes
Mayukh Deb:All the tasks that are done are up to date on GitHub
Vishwaak Chandran:It doesn't contains the code you are mentioning about.
Vishwaak Chandran:I looked into it your coding and attempt to the problems are good but in your js task I, could spot lot of white spaces between different tags and the html tag was not closed. Next time make sure you correct these small mistakes.
Mayukh Deb:Thanks ! Will keep them in mind next time I do JS
Mayukh Deb:Interesting read Thanks for the link
Vishwaak Chandran:For any program you do make sure you keep it in back of your mind.
Mayukh Deb:Okay sure
Mayukh Deb:I'm done with most of the tasks
Mayukh Deb:Project Euler some corner cases, advanced_xor, CS50 are left
Vishwaak Chandran:How's advanced xor going?
Vishwaak Chandran:CS50 is a big course and it takes lot of time.
Mayukh Deb:Will start soon
Vishwaak Chandran:Good luck with it and trust me you will need it.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi there
Vishwaak Chandran:Where are you ?
Mayukh Deb:In the room Might come to the lab after lunch asap
Vishwaak Chandran:Do mention that in the group and also the reason why you will be late.
Mayukh Deb:Okay sure
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:I won't be able to come to the lab today, wrote in the group
Vishwaak Chandran:Next time make sure you put up the reason before 10:00 am on holidays .
Mayukh Deb:I woke up at 10:30 today, but I'll try from next time onwards
Vishwaak Chandran:okay
Vishwaak Chandran:ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Mayukh Deb:I'll be coming to the lab tomorrow
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the final stading with tasks ?
Vishwaak Chandran:and btw did you read about padding and striding ?
Mayukh Deb:I had attempted Advanced xor long back, but it didn't work then because the ciphertext was wrong, so I left it CS50 and a few corner cases in Euler left
Mayukh Deb:I've read about Striding before Not much about zero padding
Mayukh Deb:Will read about zero padding then
Vishwaak Chandran:padding acutally helps in the problem of centring the pixle.
Mayukh Deb:I generally resize every image to a certain size
Mayukh Deb:By image I mean array
Vishwaak Chandran:You would loose the pixels on the corners.
Mayukh Deb:The image just gets a little bit distorted sometimes It doesn't crop the image
Vishwaak Chandran:You end up loosing the minute details it's fine doesn't affect the learning process in a large scale though.
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the idea with your dog breed classifier?
Mayukh Deb:I'm learning to handle large datasets properly through this project Also want to implement batchwise training with proper validation sets
Vishwaak Chandran:I will also start working on the same problem in the coming days.
Mayukh Deb:That's great ! Will you do it on pyTorch or TF
Vishwaak Chandran:Pytorch
Vishwaak Chandran:Will shift to TF once I get a good grip in complete construction of CNN.
Mayukh Deb:I might do the same, let's see
Vishwaak Chandran:Then in your previous project you trained your model on the entire data set?
Mayukh Deb:Batch size was 1 basically One frame propagates forward at a time, then the backprop
Mayukh Deb:A backprop occurred after each frame
Mayukh Deb:It was pretty basic But works fine for classifying between like a potato and a dog But I wanted to test it once And it worked successfully and classified between Donald Trump and Boris johnson
Vishwaak Chandran:That's fine when you classify you three or less classes. But in case of multi class classification it would take lot of time for training one single model and to reach the lowest point of the curve.
Mayukh Deb:Exactly, this is the reason I want to do it properly now for multi classes (120 in this case)
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh okay cool good luck but still a lot more to learn and also look at few CNN implementation in keras documentation they do help you out. If that's the case you should try with a smaller dataset which contains 10 classes like a cifar-10 data set.
Mayukh Deb:I'll try this one by myself first, if I fail, I'll go learn again with a smaller dataset
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay making mistakes is part of learning.
Vishwaak Chandran:When is your periodicals starting?
Mayukh Deb:Monday
Vishwaak Chandran:So you won't be able to come on weekends right?
Mayukh Deb:No I'll come after the periodicals get over
Vishwaak Chandran:So put a one messages stating that you won't come to the lab until the periodicals are over instead of everyday spamming the group.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello everyone, During the period of periodicals, there is no requirement of status update and also I noticed that during the preparation days every day there was a message popping stating they won't be coming to the lab. It's totally fine to take time off to prepare for periodicals but instead of spamming the group on a regular message just put a single message stating you won't come to the lab for a given specified period.
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you go through this message?
Mayukh Deb:I've heard that there's a point system in the daily updates Am I wrong ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Points for what?
Mayukh Deb:Yes I've gone through, but I wasn't sure because then our names pop up in the chowkidaar bot
Vishwaak Chandran:It's totally fine. The main thing about status update is that it supposed to give others s outline of the technical work you been doing else everything else is spam.
Mayukh Deb:Okay I won't send any updates until my exams are over then
Mayukh Deb:It's clear to me now, thanks
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Vishwaak Chandran:How's your project going?
Mayukh Deb:It's training on colab as of now
Vishwaak Chandran:That's cool.
Mayukh Deb:I already tried it in a smaller sample dataset of 100 images It worked then So I fed the complete dataset now
Vishwaak Chandran:The complete dataset comprises of?
Mayukh Deb:About 10,200 images Here it's 10,200 rows in the np array
Vishwaak Chandran:Lot of images.
Mayukh Deb:Which is why I moved to colab
Vishwaak Chandran:Good move.
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the sub field you are planning to focus on?
Vishwaak Chandran:In ML
Mayukh Deb:Need to do a bit of reading on that But as if now my interests are mostly biased towards computer vision/related stuff
Vishwaak Chandran:It's better then you start with a course towards computer vision.
Vishwaak Chandran:And how good are you with git?
Mayukh Deb:Push, clone, checkout, add, commit The basics I guess
Vishwaak Chandran:So how are you committing your code? Gui?
Mayukh Deb:No I'm git pushing these days
Mayukh Deb:my recent projects and recent amFOSS tasks are all pushed using the terminal
Vishwaak Chandran:Good. You need to be familiar with git commands they will be useful in the future run.
Vishwaak Chandran:Regarding this, I better suggest you to start on a course get the basics done and then move on your projects. There might be some key vital points you can miss out when you learn some stuff on your own.
Mayukh Deb:Will do a course in openCV first then Then move on to a bit more advanced pytorch Or tensorflow
Vishwaak Chandran:Namah Shivaya, I won't be coming to the lab today because I'm still not feeling well. Hope to recover by today and come from tomorrow onwards.
Vishwaak Chandran:What happened?
Vishwaak Chandran:Fever? Cold?
Mayukh Deb:Mild fever with a very bad cold.
Vishwaak Chandran:Having any medication?
Mayukh Deb:The cold is giving me a head ache
Mayukh Deb:Had Fever medicines
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay drink hot water it might help you.
Mayukh Deb:Good idea Will get hot water Thanks
Vishwaak Chandran:Do take care of your health it's the most important thing.
Vishwaak Chandran:Once your health is back to speed you can start to work again.
Mayukh Deb:I might be done with this kaggle problem in the next 2 days Then I was thinking of learning about computer vision right from the basics And also fill my knowledge gaps in NNs from online lessons
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay yeah before you start with a course do let me which one you have chosen and also the reason. Btw what's with the iot seminar? Is it part of your course work?.
Mayukh Deb:I think we'll have to do an ioT project as a part of coursework I came because attendance was being taken It ended just now
Mayukh Deb:can't fix this, I googled
Mayukh Deb:
Mayukh Deb:do i need to move to a new account ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Try opening in incognito window
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Mayukh Deb:lemme try
Mayukh Deb:same result
Mayukh Deb:I think I will have to wait for a while
Vishwaak Chandran:Probably
Vishwaak Chandran:What about tpu?
Mayukh Deb:tried
Mayukh Deb:same results
Vishwaak Chandran:Let's wait for sometime?
Mayukh Deb:yes, will make a new account till then as well
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay try it out and let me know
Mayukh Deb:It's still not working And all of my work is there
Mayukh Deb:I think I should study some chemistry today while I wait today And Complete my assignments
Vishwaak Chandran:That will be a better thing to do. I will also look into the problem and let you know a possible solution
Mayukh Deb:colab has been back up and working again
Mayukh Deb:completely rebuilt the NN again with dropout layers
Vishwaak Chandran:That's great i guess it was basically a time out for you.
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you give a readout about them ?
Mayukh Deb:2 epochs, looks a little bit better
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah it's lot better than what i saw yesterday .
Mayukh Deb:wait let me go have dinner, ill let this train till then
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay.
Mayukh Deb:It's diverting again after 5 epochs
Mayukh Deb:Just realised that the data classes aren't balanced
Mayukh Deb:Balancing them
Mayukh Deb:Should I just cut off the classes with more data ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Augmenting images should help you out.
Mayukh Deb:You mean making copies ?
Mayukh Deb:Oversampling ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah and making small changes to to them.
Mayukh Deb:Or undersampling
Mayukh Deb:Random cropping ?
Mayukh Deb:Let's try oversampling first
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah and random rotation.
Mayukh Deb:NN learns better now But it's just not there yet Should I try and remove useless background data by detecting dogs and cropping images accordingly using openCV And then generating the training data ?
Mayukh Deb:Won't take much time because I've done it for faces before
Vishwaak Chandran:Actually it's a good idea but make sure you don't overfit the model.
Mayukh Deb:No resnet models/haarcascades to detect dogs
Mayukh Deb:And I didn't find a viable way to crop out background reliably
Mayukh Deb:While this NN achieves an accuracy of about 70-75 %
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a good accuracy
Vishwaak Chandran:Probably if you tune a little more your hyper parameters you can get a bit more. Still good work.
Mayukh Deb:Do I consider this as a completion and move on to another problem with a less "noisy" dataset ?
Mayukh Deb:What should I do next ? I was thinking of using this fancy NN I made on a better and less noisy dataset Or make a simple "NN learns to play <simple racing game> "
Vishwaak Chandran:Try using the same NN for less noise data so you can work on fine tunning it more for the data.
Mayukh Deb:exactly
Mayukh Deb:I will use it on the cancer dataset
Vishwaak Chandran:In the process you can explore more fine tunning stuff
Mayukh Deb:yes yes, this time i will use the kaggle api
Vishwaak Chandran:That's better
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you complete your hacktoberfest?
Mayukh Deb:not yet, will try to complete soon
Vishwaak Chandran:Deadline on 30 Oct.
Mayukh Deb:i was thinking of working on a less noisy dataset
Mayukh Deb:found this
Mayukh Deb:need to learn to fine tune my NN with this
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a clean dataset.
Mayukh Deb:work will be easier
Mayukh Deb:so I can concentrate on the NN
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes and can practise more
Vishwaak Chandran:Instead wasting time on data.
Mayukh Deb:I'll work on this then
Vishwaak Chandran:Also make sure you complete this also.
Mayukh Deb:okay I will
Mayukh Deb:is it like absolutely necessary ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Just give it a try
Vishwaak Chandran:you get swags
Vishwaak Chandran:It's a method of getting introduced to OSS and trust me it's a good starting point. Don't miss out on it.
Vishwaak Chandran:Send me the link to your dog breed dataset.
Mayukh Deb:Sending
Mayukh Deb:some tuning is giving me this
Mayukh Deb:orange = validation loss
Vishwaak Chandran:That's fine anyway they are converging
Vishwaak Chandran:I won't be coming to the lab today because I'm on my way to vallikavvu now for some work And then I'll have to study chemistry
Vishwaak Chandran:Is chemistry that tough?
Mayukh Deb:I have my missed periodicals from 13th onwards Is it fine if I take a few days off for these exams ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah okay
Mayukh Deb:I'll be studying for my missed periodicals for this week Is it necessary to send daily updates with just "no technical work done" ?
Vishwaak Chandran:It's not required.
Mayukh Deb:Okay I won't send the update then. No spam
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Missed periodicals done?
Mayukh Deb:Yes done, but I can't make much progress because end sems are near
Vishwaak Chandran:Are you taking any certain day off?
Mayukh Deb:By off you mean ?
Mayukh Deb:The last week before the end sems I don't think I'll be coming
Vishwaak Chandran:I mean won't you be coming to lab?
Vishwaak Chandran:That's this week.
Mayukh Deb:Nope, chances are very low Should I put a message tomorrow in the group ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Mayukh Deb:Okay I'll tell in the group tomorrow, thanks !
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good.
Mayukh Deb:I was working on the project for a while in the noon, finally got it to work The NN is returning mouse co-ordinates for adjusting the steering in the game (steering is mouse controlled) And used pyautogui to move the mouse to that co-ordinate But the issues are -- Trained for only 4 epochs Very low refresh rate for the steering value when the NN steers by itself
Mayukh Deb:I'll resume after end sems now
Mayukh Deb:Video from Mayukh Deb
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Mayukh Deb:Sorry I was travelling back home
Vishwaak Chandran:It's fine. What's the plan for the holidays?
Vishwaak Chandran:On what basis are you selecting GSoC org ?
Mayukh Deb:Tbh I don't know where to start looking
Vishwaak Chandran:Start looking into the previous year GSoC selected org.
Mayukh Deb:I'm taking rest today Will start tomorrow
Vishwaak Chandran:Take your time in deciding the org don't hurry to any conclusion.
Mayukh Deb:Today in the evening
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Do take ample amount of rest before you start working on anything.
Mayukh Deb:Please send me links to organizations relevant to me if you bump into any
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah sure : )
Mayukh Deb:Thanks :) Will start with my stuff as soon as possible
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello
Mayukh Deb:I found this org
Mayukh Deb:They have projects
Vishwaak Chandran:Why this org ?
Mayukh Deb:Most of their stuff is based on CV and some web
Mayukh Deb:It's interesting but it looks a bit intimidating
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay then did you try to look into their projects ?
Mayukh Deb:I was looking into Fabrik
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the tech stack ?
Mayukh Deb:They have this issue where the logic for the padding size of the average pooling layer is not right
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay did you try joining their irc or mailing list ?
Mayukh Deb:Nothing as such
Mayukh Deb:How do I start ?
Vishwaak Chandran:First try setting up the local enviroment and the give a formal intro in their mailing list
Mayukh Deb:Yes
Mayukh Deb:And I have to write the monthly plan as well
Mayukh Deb:Should I invest more time for looking for organizations ?
Mayukh Deb:Or try this ?
Vishwaak Chandran:This is a good org but do have a back up org
Mayukh Deb:Am I free to change later on if I find something better ?
Mayukh Deb:No
Mayukh Deb:I'll have to look
Vishwaak Chandran:Stick on to one don't switch no matter what
Vishwaak Chandran:Only to your back up org
Mayukh Deb:Is it necessary to look for one now ?
Mayukh Deb:Or should I set up a local env now
Vishwaak Chandran:Set it up
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:It's always better to start early.
Mayukh Deb:It runs on python 2.7
Mayukh Deb:Bad news I guess
Vishwaak Chandran:Not really
Mayukh Deb:Written on the readme
Mayukh Deb:That's trouble I guess
Vishwaak Chandran:You should be able to handle it
Vishwaak Chandran:it's not that hard
Mayukh Deb:There's another org
Mayukh Deb:JdeRobot
Vishwaak Chandran:Let this be the backup org
Mayukh Deb:this seems interesting, was in their ideas list last year. nobody did this one
Vishwaak Chandran:Change the sheet access level
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:How long the project has been active for ?
Vishwaak Chandran:I consider it as a dead project there will be nothing to contribute to it. Even if you have something it might be small fixes nothing major nor will you gain something . So scrap this project.
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Why was is the doc incomplete and why was it not informed ? Next time before submitting a doc get it review it from me and then you can submit it. Never ever submit a half completed doc for review. it's like WASTING reviewers time. What happned to the vaction plan and to the vaction update?
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Mayukh Deb:I'm outside rn, will complete the doc tonight And will chalk out the vacation plan
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Fill the sheet with selected org
Mayukh Deb:Since the afternoon I'm outside with my dad in a relative's place, will work at night for sure
Vishwaak Chandran:It's fine DO NOT work on a weekend.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you Update the sheet?
Mayukh Deb:I'll have to go to my grandparents place today with my dad. And I might have to stay until late So I'll work on the coming weekend to compensate
Vishwaak Chandran:.
Mayukh Deb:Yes, done yesterday. I've shortlisted
Vishwaak Chandran:What are those?
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:orgs - CloudCV, CBMI@UTHSC, Earth Science Information Partners, red hen lab
Mayukh Deb:is it necessary for me to fix an issue first ? or can I just make possible improvements if any
Vishwaak Chandran:Fixing issues will help you out in uderstading the code base
Vishwaak Chandran:Where is the Vaction plan ?
Mayukh Deb:vacation plan is basically my monthly plan for december
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:What have you decided for GSoC ? What's the final org you have choosen ?
Mayukh Deb:I want to try for CBMI@UTHSC
Vishwaak Chandran:It would be better if you stick with cloudcv
Vishwaak Chandran:Why didn't you update the sheet ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Is there a problem your facing ?
Vishwaak Chandran:What happened to the vaction status update. It's been more than three days since you sent the last update . What's the reason ? If I ask you follow something do follow it
Mayukh Deb:Not a problem, but there are a lot of guests over at my place, they'll stay until Sunday
Mayukh Deb:I'll send the vacation update here ?
Vishwaak Chandran:It works
Mayukh Deb:Okay sure
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay that's fine. But don't forget to update the sheet when they ask in the main group
Mayukh Deb:I'll have to fill the "final org" column
Mayukh Deb:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah do that
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Mayukh Deb:The project is empty in CBMI@UTHSC
Mayukh Deb:And the past projects were pretty do able
Vishwaak Chandran:We don't know if that org will get into GSoC this year.
Vishwaak Chandran:That's the main, problem
Mayukh Deb:Should I try and communicate with them ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah better
Mayukh Deb:Oh I didn't consider that
Vishwaak Chandran:Ask them what are they planning to do for this gsoc in a indirect way
Mayukh Deb:How should I communicate ? Formal intro over email ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Mayukh Deb:Should I mention my background ?
Mayukh Deb:Like what I'm doing and studies etc
Vishwaak Chandran:Join the mailing list and then the IRC channel if they have one.
Mayukh Deb:No IRC
Vishwaak Chandran:Do mention them
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Mayukh Deb:Do they check our github profiles ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Join the mailing list give a proper introduction and see whether they communicate
Vishwaak Chandran:They might
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the matter?
Mayukh Deb:I'll show you the drafted email before sending
Mayukh Deb:No no I was just curious
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good.
Mayukh Deb:Btw I'm done with the current project
Vishwaak Chandran:Which one?
Mayukh Deb:Have a look at this
Mayukh Deb:This project
Vishwaak Chandran:That's really good congrats on that part.
Mayukh Deb:what should be the things that I should mention in the email ?
Vishwaak Chandran:What do you plan to do for the vaction.
Mayukh Deb:and send it just you ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Wait which mail ?
Vishwaak Chandran:intro mail?
Mayukh Deb:yes
Mayukh Deb:intro mail
Mayukh Deb:should I just ask on whether I can work on it or not ? or something more
Vishwaak Chandran:It should contain who you are and where your from . What all tech stack you know and what you do with them.
Mayukh Deb:okay
Mayukh Deb:should I mention that my recent projects involve the stuff that's required for this project ?
Vishwaak Chandran:No not required
Vishwaak Chandran:Just attach your github link in the bottom they will look into it
Mayukh Deb:okay
Mayukh Deb:have a look, its not complete yet though
Mayukh Deb:Please make any changes necessary in the doc, I'll update it and ping you as well
Vishwaak Chandran:Wait I have to change the suggestion
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:The content is good
Vishwaak Chandran:Made few changes you can send the email.
Mayukh Deb:Should I attach my GitHub link at the bottom ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah do it
Mayukh Deb:Should I join the mailing list and send it there Or send it to the contact email
Vishwaak Chandran:Join the mailing list
Vishwaak Chandran:And then send it there
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Mayukh Deb:Just have a final look, I made some minor changes
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Mayukh Deb:What do I write here ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Tell them why, you, want to be part of their mailing list
Mayukh Deb:Because I want to contribute to one of their projects
Mayukh Deb:Will that do ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah just that will do. Do tell them in a indirect way
Mayukh Deb:Tell what, that I want to contribute ?
Vishwaak Chandran:You want to contribute to one of their project
Vishwaak Chandran:And your new open source software
Mayukh Deb:Can it just be like " I'm interested in contributing to one of the projects " Just this ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Add the new to open source thing
Vishwaak Chandran:It will help
Mayukh Deb:"I want to contribute to one of the projects here and start my open source journey"
Mayukh Deb:This ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes
Mayukh Deb:Okay sending
Vishwaak Chandran:OK cool
Mayukh Deb:Sent, fingers crossed
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah good luck
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you get into the mailing list?
Mayukh Deb:I should wait until tomorrow I guess, because US has a different time zone
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay let me know if there are any further development
Mayukh Deb:should I send this email to Mr. Akram l ? in his email I mean while I'm waiting to get accepted into the group
Vishwaak Chandran:Who is that?
Vishwaak Chandran:And why should you mail him?
Mayukh Deb:guy who mentors mostly
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay then yes
Mayukh Deb:okay
Vishwaak Chandran:What will you mail him?
Mayukh Deb:this
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah you can.
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah just take a look into it.
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Vishwaak Chandran:Still no response?
Mayukh Deb:Not yet
Mayukh Deb:I'm building Fabrik from cloudCV
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you pick any issue?
Mayukh Deb:Avg pooling layer padding calculation logic is wrong, it leads to wrong calculation of the total no. of parameters
Mayukh Deb:I'll try to fix that
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try to replicate the issue?
Mayukh Deb:I was facing errors while building
Mayukh Deb:So I contacted them on gitter
Mayukh Deb:And got some help
Mayukh Deb:Not yet, but soon
Vishwaak Chandran:Good going
Vishwaak Chandran:Before you start working on issue make sure that issue first exist then replicate then you can start, working on a solution for that.
Mayukh Deb:Okay
Mayukh Deb:I'll keep you updated
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Mayukh Deb:Okay, I'll be careful from the next time
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Mayukh Deb:Hi
Vishwaak Chandran:How's the bug solving going ?
Mayukh Deb:Could not work for the last 2 days
Vishwaak Chandran:What happened ?
Vishwaak Chandran:New year huh ?
Mayukh Deb:Yes
Mayukh Deb:I found the file where the bug possible lies in
Mayukh Deb:And the function as well
Mayukh Deb:I'll be replicating the issue soon
Vishwaak Chandran:btw, Happy new Year : )
Mayukh Deb:Happy new year :)
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah that's good make sure you are able to fix the bug end of this week.
Vishwaak Chandran:When are you returuing to college ?
Mayukh Deb:7th
Mayukh Deb:Evening
Vishwaak Chandran:But did you try to replicate the issue ?
Mayukh Deb:After installing it took me some time to just play with the software and see what lies where
Mayukh Deb:I'll just have to make a simple CNN with average pooling and calculate it's parameters manually And check with the numbers given by Fabrik
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay and it turned out to be wrong ?
Mayukh Deb:As the issue says, it has to be wrong Didn't check yet
Vishwaak Chandran:Check that first.
Mayukh Deb:Yes yes
Mayukh Deb:Will do that first
Vishwaak Chandran:How's the parameters are been calculated ?
Mayukh Deb:The file where I suspect the bug is
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Mayukh Deb:I think they got the formula wrong

Mayukh Deb:is that enough for a small pull request ? would that help ?
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a good thing just ask the community members whether it's needed or not based on that decide . First you will need to rise a issue then you can make a pull request
Mayukh Deb:should i ask about making a pull request ?
Vishwaak Chandran:No ask them whether it's required or not the fourth step
Vishwaak Chandran:If they say create a issue in the project and then make the pull request
Mayukh Deb:what exactly should I ask ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Tell them you feel that readme is missing a forth step and you feel it's viral for running the program

Vishwaak Chandran:Actually it's not a forth step on the list rather it's a new step .
Mayukh Deb:"Need a new step on the docker installation instructions" this ?
Vishwaak Chandran:You just need to change the argument in command . I feel it's actually not required as this much of spoon feeding will not accepted by any org

Vishwaak Chandran:What happened?
lasya:Eda the thing is ryt now I'm solving problems (codeforces). Sandesh Bhaiyya gave 2 months time for me, Amit and Amruth to prove ourselves to be in problem solving team. By now 2 months r over. Ig he will let us know the results by tmrw. And they told if u r in problem solving team u have to mainly concentrate on solving problems not on hackathons and all. Ik there is very less possibility of me getting selected. But Donno Wat to do
lasya:Edaa I really have no idea Wat to do. I'm confused daa. I thought I'll tell u everything as u r my frnd. But plz don't tell this thing to anyone else.

lasya:I'm not selected
lasya:Ig I can join ur team.
lasya:
Vishwaak Chandran:That's cool
lasya:
Vishwaak Chandran:Selection does not matter to persure your choice of interest. Always pressure things which your interested in. If you were selected in the team you would have had some mentor to help you out. Now it's like your jungle and you rule the entire place. Just try solving harder problems like graph, binary tree, trees and more. Just keep things as secret until they request you tell them. Improve more everyday than you did in the last month. Go for C problems. Let them recognize your talent.
lasya:Yesss daa I'll do that. Thank u so much yaar. Can I join ur team?

lasya:So he suggested me to take tht project
Vishwaak Chandran:it's more complicated than you think

lasya:He told it may take 3-4 months to complete
lasya:He took 6 months to complete
Vishwaak Chandran:you need to know lot more stuff in programming before you can start with something big like that
Vishwaak Chandran:first start with small things and then go for big things

lasya:Edaaa but my mentor suggested me to do tht na
Vishwaak Chandran:so what
lasya:Ohh
Vishwaak Chandran:?
lasya:No ntg like tht
Vishwaak Chandran:it's just a suggestion

lasya:its a learning curve u will learn it
lasya:this one month u have to show a SOLID work , remember other wise when juniors come there will be member ship review and u wont be able to show anything remarkable
lasya:But I am informing before itself, it is related to hardware, But it helps u through out 3rd and 4th sem ece concepts .
lasya:Worth learning
lasya:it needs lots of patience and dedication, other wise u wont be able to complete

lasya:if u are ready for all these then ok
Vishwaak Chandran:so you want to start with OS ?

lasya:if they feel like I can do it
lasya:Then they asked me to proceed
Vishwaak Chandran:okay if you have made up your mind to work on the project . But still let me warn you it's a a very huge project it will eat lot of time. Imho you need to learn a lot before you do a project.
lasya:I think I'll look into it today on the internet and try to find more about it. So I'll take a decision after that.
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a good step. How is that going ?

Khare Foss:Like maybe 30, 20, 10?
Vishwaak Chandran:We can if we want
Khare Foss:Ok I'll try I'll say the hackathon is in feb, then I'll say we preponed it to vidyut
Khare Foss:I'll try with this budget fine?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah that's fine ig
Khare Foss:And dude, I'll need some good brochure or advertisement stuff
Khare Foss:Can that be done by today?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah come to the group
Khare Foss:Or a good website will suffice
Khare Foss:?
Vishwaak Chandran:First we need to know if the hackathon is possible. Or not
Vishwaak Chandran:So. We first create a base. Plan then we project it to the vidyuth team and then we decide other stuff
Khare Foss:Dude i can't ask GitHub unless we get the hackathon confirmed. In case it doesn't happen, it'll be bad
Khare Foss:I'll still talk to the guys and ask what they can do
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah we will get the base plan ready by today.
Vishwaak Chandran:So we can get the confirmation by tonight
Vishwaak Chandran:Then you can ask. For the sponsorship
Khare Foss:Ok
Khare Foss:Dude sorry Sir told some stuff to do which involves going to kollam You carry on the discussion I'll join in the afternoon
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah okay
Vishwaak Chandran:Wait for 20 mins O'Neill get back to you
Vishwaak Chandran:Taking these points into consideration - target crowd is jobless people coming to college not for learning but for having fun - its a hackathon. what hackathon fetches you money? hackathons are done hand in hand with companies who want some problem to be solved. -Only thing we will gain is going to be PR. -During this period productivity of the club will also reduce. Shall we drop the thing?
Khare Foss:I'll wait for O'Neill to get back to me
Vishwaak Chandran:For the event
Vishwaak Chandran:Do we really need to do this event is a questuin now?
Khare Foss:Maybe let's have the hackathon but smaller prizes
Khare Foss:Like I'll ask for 10-15k We'll buy prizes like headphones amd shit That's it
Khare Foss:Let's do something atleast
Vishwaak Chandran:But at end of the day we are not gonna gain anything
Vishwaak Chandran:Otherwise than pr
Vishwaak Chandran:We have lot of other works like getting the first year did ready for the their gsoc
Vishwaak Chandran:Those are high priority job aren't they?
Khare Foss:Can't be do just something for namesake?
Vishwaak Chandran:We already have amdec for that
Vishwaak Chandran:No
Khare Foss:Last year vidyut hackathon tha na?
Khare Foss:It was stupid
Khare Foss:But it happened
Khare Foss:Just a small thing
Vishwaak Chandran:If we do something we need to something good. We can't spoil the club name
Khare Foss:That's why we'll keep the good prizes
Vishwaak Chandran:Once the reputation goes down it will be really hard to bring it back
Khare Foss:Yeah
Vishwaak Chandran:What about the first years ?we have to track and guide them in this month. Else it's going to be very hard
Vishwaak Chandran:I don't want to this event affect the reputation nor the first year
Khare Foss:Same here
Vishwaak Chandran:So it's better to drop
Khare Foss:Theek We'll leave this thing
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay
Khare Foss:so shall we dissolve that group?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah
C. Anirudh:Hey Vishwaak , are you maintaining the hackathon tracker?
Vishwaak Chandran:No anna
C. Anirudh:Do you know who is maintaining that?

C. Anirudh:Reasons?
C. Anirudh:Did you talk to anyone from Vidyut?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah to most of the people
C. Anirudh:What did they say?
Vishwaak Chandran:Not to viduyt people
Vishwaak Chandran:We feel that this event at the end of the day will only give us few PR other than that we don't gain anything. So we feels it's better to drop this event rather than proceeding future with it
C. Anirudh:ok cool It will be a lot of work for just some PR, so not worth it
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes anna

Vishwaak Chandran:Is it your first commit for the project?
Sanjana Nayar:no...
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the change in this commit?
Sanjana Nayar:like this folder has the settings and wsgi settings and everything, so what commit msg do I give for this?
Vishwaak Chandran:See in the initial commit you push all the basic folders required to rebuild the project.
Sanjana Nayar:i didnt understand
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay see if I right now clone your project. Will it work in my local system?
Sanjana Nayar:i didnt finish it so no
Vishwaak Chandran:That's not what I meant

Vishwaak Chandran:No it's not like that
Vishwaak Chandran:Commit are like checkpoints

Vishwaak Chandran:What are the remaining files to be committed?
Sanjana Nayar:theres one more folder
Sanjana Nayar:but thats incomplete
Vishwaak Chandran:Commit all the basic files for the project and then squash these commits into the initial commit . Then commit the features you have completed into different commits.
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you get it?

Sanjana Nayar:i understood what is to be done but i havent squashed commits before so i'll do that now
Vishwaak Chandran:Try it out if your stuck anywhere just let me know.
Sanjana Nayar:okay

Vishwaak Chandran:Yes the first part is right.
Vishwaak Chandran:Then make individuals commits for the login page and sign up page.
Sanjana Nayar:i didnt understand
Vishwaak Chandran:1)squash all commits you have right now into the inital commit. 2) you have completed the sign-up ND login profile right? 3) now commit the code of sign up page into a commit . 4)next commit the code for login profile. 5)push all changes.

Sanjana Nayar:got it
Sanjana Nayar:This is the draft..
Sanjana Nayar:hello chetta
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes ?
Sanjana Nayar:how do I select an organization? do I choose the one that interests me or are there any guidelines?
Vishwaak Chandran:There are few things which needs to be taken into consideration before you select a organization: -> Select a organization based on the Programming language you know or the tech stack you want to work on. -> Else pick a organization based on your intreset ->Then try setting up the local dev environment -> Try sending a small patch.
Sanjana Nayar:ok...
Sanjana Nayar:hi
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello
Sanjana Nayar:i am confused about the organization to choose
Sanjana Nayar:what do i do
Sanjana Nayar:i shortlisted CERN and django but im not very sure...
Vishwaak Chandran:CERN might be a bit tough to start with
Sanjana Nayar:thats what I thought too...
Sanjana Nayar:but the idea interests me'
Vishwaak Chandran:But why did you choose these orgs?
Sanjana Nayar:cern cz ive always been interested in what they do and wanted to contribute ,, django cz im working on django rn and im not completely blank in it
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay considering the case CERN would be a big jump right now. It's better you proceed with Django.
Sanjana Nayar:okay...
Sanjana Nayar:i didnt get time to go through all the orgs today and yest cz i was busy... will take 1 more day to completly check
Vishwaak Chandran:Go through all the org and finalize in by the coming weekend.
Sanjana Nayar:yes
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the update on the prroject ?
Vishwaak Chandran:I don't see any commits
Sanjana Nayar:its happening...im not able to fix the errors...ive to search more
Vishwaak Chandran:What are the error ?
Vishwaak Chandran:How long have you been stuck with the problem?
Sanjana Nayar:i got operational error saying I can't add tables
Sanjana Nayar:then i wanted to add a homepage so that as soon as my link address is clicked my own homepage comes
Sanjana Nayar:this is almost done
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try this out ?
Vishwaak Chandran:That's good.
Vishwaak Chandran:Make sure keep pushing your code as you make changes in the code bases. Your Github timline is most important.
Vishwaak Chandran:Also make sure you fill the Sheet with your selected org
Sanjana Nayar:yes i'll do it...
Sanjana Nayar:shall i choose mozilla...i looked into their projects and they are active also
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the project do you plan to select in that org ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Setting up mozilla is really difficult and it takes time and you might get lost in the process .It would be better if you get some expericence before pursuing mozilla .
Sanjana Nayar:i also searched for beginner organizations in google... many of them showed mozilla..
Sanjana Nayar:thats one more reason
Vishwaak Chandran:Aha trust me it's not . It looks like easy peasy but it's not. All the bug are too old and it requires a very good hold of the language.
Sanjana Nayar:ohhh...
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Update the sheet
Sanjana Nayar:yes
Sanjana Nayar:i short-listed gnu mailman and chaoss...
Vishwaak Chandran:Gnu mailman ?
Sanjana Nayar:yes..
Vishwaak Chandran:Was the org part of GSoC 2019 ?
Sanjana Nayar:yup
Vishwaak Chandran:earlier ?
Sanjana Nayar:only 1 project was there tho
Vishwaak Chandran:CHAOSS is a good org
Sanjana Nayar:not there in '18
Sanjana Nayar:but other gnu orgs are there
Vishwaak Chandran:aha then we don't know whether they will make it into 2020
Sanjana Nayar:ohhh
Vishwaak Chandran:So finally you are going with this list ?
Sanjana Nayar:i'll check more ig..but chaoss can be there right
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah CHAOSS is a good org
Vishwaak Chandran:What happened to earlier selection ?
Sanjana Nayar:cern and django is too high-level for me now ig
Sanjana Nayar:also mozilla
Vishwaak Chandran:why do you think so ?
Sanjana Nayar:.
Sanjana Nayar:.
Sanjana Nayar:akhil chetta also said the same
Sanjana Nayar:also about django
Vishwaak Chandran:CHAOSS last year they had data analytics projects
Vishwaak Chandran:Check this one
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping
Vishwaak Chandran:Try building mozilla in your local system if your are able to build the system then we can even have select mozilla.
Sanjana Nayar:okay..
Sanjana Nayar:unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock, is another process using it? error is coming
Sanjana Nayar:tried googliing, didnt understand
Vishwaak Chandran:Try using sudo
Vishwaak Chandran:If not restart the system do not run any process, just run the required line.
Sanjana Nayar:Tried using sudo ..still same
Sanjana Nayar:Ok....
Vishwaak Chandran:Did it work?
Sanjana Nayar:worked!
Vishwaak Chandran:What's the current status ?
Sanjana Nayar:there's a CalledProcessError
Sanjana Nayar:trying to figure that out
Vishwaak Chandran:During build time ?
Sanjana Nayar:when i ran the python script
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you check the minimal configuration required for the build ?
Sanjana Nayar:doubt
Sanjana Nayar:im building it ina new directory src
Sanjana Nayar:so if ive to install things like rustc and some other things should i cd into src and then install everything or can i install in home itself?
Sanjana Nayar:btw this is the exact error " raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd) subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '[u'sudo', u'apt-get', u'update']'eturned non-zero exit status 100"
Vishwaak Chandran:That shouldn't be a problem. You don't have to install everything separately as the build takes the rustc which is specified in the global environmental variable.
Vishwaak Chandran:.
Sanjana Nayar:yup.. everything excpt libgtk-2-dev is installed
Vishwaak Chandran:Check the amount of swap memory you have and the required swap memory.
Vishwaak Chandran:Install it manually
Sanjana Nayar:trying to install libgtk-2-dev says " could'nt find any package whose name or description matched "libgtk-2-dev""
Vishwaak Chandran:The package may be deprecated
Vishwaak Chandran:Search for the latest package
Sanjana Nayar:it got solved when i imported public keys

Venu Senior:and also use git as vcs
Vishwaak Chandran:Will keep it in mind while creating a repo from now ow

Vishwaak Chandran:Lol
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah everything is data after all
Vishwaak Chandran:Hey Venu Anna, It's was really a awesome experience to be part of the neuro AI conference. I did have lot things to learn since it has a mix of bio in it. It was a really a different experience. The best part is I was able to meet different people from different technical background and got to know lot more stuff to improve. To improve my tech circle. Each presentation had a unique element of there own and we're also one of a kind. They were also able to move robots with brain waves. Even though it had lot of theory but the end of day one they showed us some practical stuff. Day 2 was lot different it was completely on the biological working of the brain. It's fascinating to know we still don't understand how we work.
Venu Senior:maybe shorten a bit and share in group
Vishwaak Chandran:Lol okay : )
Venu Senior:good that you got to know few new things

Rithvik:Can u send me photos when free
Rithvik:?
Rithvik:Thank youuu
Rithvik:Do u by any chance have the video of the dance
Rithvik:oh
Vinay:if you have the
Vishwaak Chandran:It's really a big organization.
Vinay:yeahh
Vinay:but if you have some experience, it will be ok
Vinay:but it is a risky one....lot of competetion
Vishwaak Chandran:Will keep that in mind
Vishwaak Chandran:btw your project is on computer vision right? what exactly are you doing ?
Vinay:well
Vinay:there is a microscopic worm called C. Elegans
Vinay:it has around 206 neurons only...while we have billions
Vinay:it's difficult to study our brain as it is very complex....so they try to understand how the brain of that worm works and apply their findings to humans
Vinay:my project is to segment the cells of C .elegans during its embryogenesis process
Vinay:embryogenesis process - the process of a organism forming from a single cell (by multiplying)
Vishwaak Chandran:But the neurons we have are very much complicated than the worms have.
Vishwaak Chandran:Still it's a lot .
Vishwaak Chandran:So your basically modeling it's brain.
Vinay:usually the process takes 3 days
Vinay:my org does that
Vinay:my task is to segment the cells as the process happens
Vinay:dpending on the way the organism is dividing, we learn it's characterstics
Vishwaak Chandran:segment on the basis of what ?
Vinay:yeah, but they are hoping that they might discover something
Vinay:
Vinay:this is a sample image
Vinay:I have to do semantic segmentation
Vinay:the challenging part is that there are no lables
Vinay:I have to do unsupervised semantic segmentation....
Vishwaak Chandran:That's hard.
Vinay:veryyy
Vishwaak Chandran:venu is pulling me to dinner
Vishwaak Chandran:brb
Vishwaak Chandran:
Vinay:I found a paper which uses convolutional autoencoders and uses something called soft-normalized-graph cut loss
Vishwaak Chandran:That's venu Anna don't. Mind him.
Vishwaak Chandran:That's interesting.
Vinay:but did not get good resutls
Vinay:I'll also go to dinner
Vishwaak Chandran:What is the activation function did you use?
Vinay:softmax
Vinay:on the final layer
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you try any custom activation function ?
Vinay:no
Vinay:a lot has happened in between....which put me behind the schedule...So I couldn't try anything unusual to see if works
Vishwaak Chandran:Do you have the implementation in your github?
Vinay:yes....I took the loss function implementation from there.
Vinay:but did not work very well
Vinay:It is a lot of mathamatics actually
Vinay:I couldn't fully understand it
Vishwaak Chandran:It's sometimes tough getting them right.
Vishwaak Chandran:I met a interesting guy sometime back he has his own activation function and it seams to be good.
Vinay:That's greater
Vinay:That's great*
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello anna
Vishwaak Chandran:How do you find the sub orgs under incf ?
Vinay:These are the ideas for 2019.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna looking into them
Vinay:GSoC 2020 got announced. There will be so many orgs that are not popular for ML, but will have ML projects. Make sure you find them because they usually have less competetion.
Vinay:Orgs like RedHen, CLIPS will have so many people.
Vishwaak Chandran:How do i find this organization? Is the million, dollar, question anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah okay anna
Vinay:You have to go through each org which has machine learning or data NLP or computer vision tags
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh okay Anna. But everytime I do that I endup in their big website from there no way to reach their small organization
Vishwaak Chandran:But did figure out some orgs related to numfocus
Vinay:yess. NumFocus is a great org. It will always have ML projects.
Vishwaak Chandran:Too much competition right?
Vishwaak Chandran:The idea of brian is nice
Vishwaak Chandran:I will try contacting those org people.
Vinay:As soon as the projects for 2020 are announced (all the major orgs which are certain to be selected will put these up before the orgs are announced), go through them and contact them.
Vinay:Doing this will give you advantage.
Vinay:AFAIK, I don't think INCF people have decided on the 2020 ideas list.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna will start the process right away. Will use previous years orgs list to find out about project
Vinay:That is great
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh okay Anna but the sub orgs will have some idea right Anna?.
Vinay:for INCF?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Like the brainsimulator org?
Vinay:Should have I guess. The fact is that the sub-orgs list for INCF is a mess unlike NumFocus.
Vinay:So I'm not sure where you can find the websites for the sub-orgs and sub-projects.
Vinay:You can go through the 2019 ideas list and contact the respective mentors. They will tell you more about where to find the project specifics.
Vishwaak Chandran:That's a better idea Anna
Vinay:Also, luck can play a factor in this.
Vishwaak Chandran:Always been on hard side of luck
Vinay:There might a Masters student wanting to work on the project that you are already working on.
Vinay:So one can never be sure.
Vishwaak Chandran:Anyway will try to contact the respective mentor
Vinay:It happens, but all that we could do is give our best. The rest will happen.
Vinay:sure.
Vishwaak Chandran:I will, try out the best and hope for the best
Vishwaak Chandran:That's something we can't predict
Vinay:Also, be careful about new orgs. You might find a project from new org in 2020. I advice not to completely rely on it as new orgs will have very less slots given to them. So even if they like your proposal, chances are there that the project you have applied for doesn't get a slot.
Vinay:yes. It happend to me in 2018
Vishwaak Chandran:Will take that into consideration anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Lot of factors to keep in mind
Vinay:Yess. I was in a mess when preparing.
Vishwaak Chandran:It's going to be pretty hard decision to decide on the org. Once I select a org shall i let you know and can you give me your idea?
Vinay:Something I did which helped me was, I contacted previous GSoC students and I asked them about the competition.
Vinay:Yeah sure.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna but will, they respond?
Vinay:Meanwhile go through the websites of major orgs (which have been selected since last 4-5 years) and look for their 2020 ideas list. You may find something related to ML.
Vinay:You just have to try. Some will and some will not.
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Anna but too much analysis needs to be done.
Vinay:Yes.
Vishwaak Chandran:I hope to finalize on a sub org by next, weekend and start contributing
Vinay:Alright, All the
Vishwaak Chandran:Thank you Anna : )

Vishwaak Chandran:Namah Shivaya sir, I am Vishwaak vibothi Anna mentee. Today evening he messaged me that he can't mentor anymore and he is stepping back. But sir the amount of knowledge i have gained from his mentoring is immense. I would really like him to continue mentoring me. Is there a possibility of talking Anna back into mentoring?
Vipin sir:Ok
Vishwaak Chandran:I asked the my organization about my proposal but still no response from then and then I showed the comments made by them in my proposal to viboothi Anna. He asked me to reduce the scope of the project. I am working on it. Sir can you help me with the correction of my proposal?
Vipin sir:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:Shall i share the document sir ?
Vipin sir:Yes
Vipin sir:Can you call me
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay Sir
Vishwaak Chandran:Sir I check it up .Only the owner of the docs get's notified about the comment's made in the doc
Vipin sir:can you call me
Vipin sir:you mentioned various things like Contribution board:
Vipin sir:etc
Vipin sir:so can you have a mock screen design about how this is supposed to look like ?
Vipin sir:You cant finish all this in the specified gsoc time frame
Vipin sir:that is why they said this is a lot
Vipin sir:Reduce it to what you can actually do
Vipin sir:If you dont understand what I said please feel free to call
Vipin sir:When Rasmus mentioned that IMHO out of scope for this GSOC - the involved concepts are just not sufficiently mature He is saying that this is a lot of work. Your reply does not make sense there
Vishwaak Chandran:I had the wireframe design in the Doc sir .
Vishwaak Chandran:Sir but according to the design view they shared to me it had lot things to implemented . I wanted to bring in as many feature i could. Since time is a constrian i am trying to reduce the number of feature and pushing the remaining one 's into extened feature of teh project and viboothi anna is helping me cutting it down.
Vipin sir:Ok
Vipin sir:But extended features should not be in this document
Vishwaak Chandran:they are possible feature which can be implemented on the my project for better experience . Wouldn't be nice to list some of them sir?
Vipin sir:Only if you are doing it
Vipin sir:Document has to have narrow focus
Vipin sir:Ok lots of details missing
Vipin sir:I put in few more comments
Vipin sir:you really need to mention the algorithm for scoring
Vipin sir:give example Say there are two different pull requests that got merged How many points will they be given and why ? Explain with details Details is everything
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay sir i will fill in the details for the contribution boards .
Vipin sir:Ok
Vipin sir:Honestly when I read this I get the impression you have no idea what you are talking about
Vipin sir:there are no details at all
Vipin sir:How can the person really know what you are talking about and how you are going to implement
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes sir i noticed those points . I have refactored the entire proposal keeping in mind the point's you have mentioned about the proposal sir.
Vipin sir:Ok
Vipin sir:Will check tomorrow
Vipin sir:Check if your mentor can give comments
Vishwaak Chandran:Thank you sir for spending your valuable time for reviewing my proposal sir.
Vipin sir:can you meet me today ?
Vipin sir:may be during lunch
Vipin sir:etc
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay sir. In cyber lab?
Vipin sir:Yes
Vishwaak Chandran:I have reached cyber sir
Vishwaak Chandran:Sir I submitted my final proposal after a lot of reviewing and added lot points to explain my points and also i have realized that I need to improve my writing skills and the way to express things. Abinand Anaa and Viboothi Anna helped in frameing down the proposal . The mentor also mentioned that the idea look mature now. Thank you sir for taking time from your busy schedule to help me in my proposal.
Vishwaak Chandran:Sir venu Anna asked me to meet you.where should I come sir?
Vipin sir:In front of college
Vishwaak Chandran:Namah Shivaya Sir, I am interested in taking up the project you mentioned last Sunday.
Vipin sir:Which one
Vishwaak Chandran:To measure the impact of the session we take on open source.
Vipin sir:Ok
Vishwaak Chandran:Namah Shivaya sir, On Dec 8th we had planned for arranging FOSS night as it seemed to be the only date where the first would be able to participate and as well as the forth years . So sir is there a possibility to shift the date of ooenstack event?
Vipin sir:Open stack is an external event
Vipin sir:let me see if they confirmed
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay sir.
Vishwaak Chandran:Sir today morning a faculty contacted me from etumadai campus . He requires a student to work with him in blockchain. There is already a student from our campus who is working on a project. The first part will be knowledge transfer between the students. Then the faculty and the students will work on blockchain project for a period of 1 year. He asked if any student from our club is interested. Abieshek bvs Anna is already working on blockchain or should I ask some first year. The project is a remote project and he requires 1 student. He mentioned the project period will start immediate. The faculty name is sangeeth and he is from wireless network department.
Vipin sir:How did he contact you
Vishwaak Chandran:Sir I was coming to college today morning. We shared the same auto then we had the conversation.
Vipin sir:Ah ok
Vishwaak Chandran:And he also gave his email ID. Asking the interested student to contact him.
Vipin sir:I know Br Sangeeth well
Vishwaak Chandran:Oh, okay sir.
Vishwaak Chandran:Hello Anna, Can we push the mediawiki training camp date to Dec 22?
Rammanoj:Nope....
Rammanoj:mostly
Vishwaak Chandran:why can't it be pushed ?
Rammanoj:there is an organization that generally gives the funds to such events. We've asked him long back about the event and we postponed it many times for some reasons.
Rammanoj:At last we finalized on 2nd week of dec.
Rammanoj:I can change the date, but I think it won't be good if I still ask him to change!!
Rammanoj:for FOSS night ?
Vishwaak Chandran:Yes if we conduct foss night on dec 08 and then mlh build day on dec 15 and then mediawiki trianing on dec
Rammanoj:any time between 8th and 15th ??
Vishwaak Chandran:Foss night on dec 08 as first year will only have to stay for two days during their vactions.
Vishwaak Chandran:And ig mediawiki training camp was decided to be held on dec 15
Rammanoj:nope who said you that ?
Vishwaak Chandran:gopa anna asked for that date.
Vishwaak Chandran:Dec 14, 15 for Mediawiki Training okay ?
Rammanoj:ohh ok I asked him to fix one, and I even don't know abt it.
Rammanoj:I'll try to talk to gopa and see once.
Vishwaak Chandran:So is there a possiblity to push the date to dec 22? . If that can be done it would be great.
Rammanoj:will check it out ...
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay awesome can you let me know the final decision by tuesday ?
Rammanoj:fine
Vishwaak Chandran:Thank you anna
Rammanoj:when are holidays starting to juniors ?
Rammanoj:1st years
Vishwaak Chandran:Dec 6th to jan 6th
Rammanoj:so do you think anyone will look back if the event is conducted on dec 22 ?
Vishwaak Chandran:I would say that purely depeands on the marketing skills.
Rammanoj:but how great your marketing skills be, the near by people may come, but what about the people from delhi and some other places ?
Rammanoj:it will take more the 2 days (by train) to reach out
Vishwaak Chandran:If you want all the years to particiapte in that event then the only thing possible is to postpond the event.
Rammanoj:we are planning this only for first years
Rammanoj:not all the years
Rammanoj:as far as I know
Vishwaak Chandran:Then Dec 08 is the only possible date .
Rammanoj:not completely ....
Rammanoj:we can conduct after the foss night
Vishwaak Chandran:That will be when ?
Rammanoj:in the second week of dec...
Rammanoj:let me check with gopa
Vishwaak Chandran:Still most of the first years would be in home.
Rammanoj:to get you the exact date
Rammanoj:as it was the starting of the holidays, they may wait for it and book the tickets after that..... (my opinion)
Rammanoj:and I might not be even avialable after dec 22.
Vishwaak Chandran:imho i don't think so.
Rammanoj:let's see...
Rammanoj:can you check it with gopa once ?
Vishwaak Chandran:That's the reason Foss night should be arranged on dec 08
Rammanoj:
Rammanoj:isn't it possible to conduct it after foss night ?
Rammanoj:around 10th and 11th or 9th...
Vishwaak Chandran:If that's the case those are working dates we need to get lab and permission for studetns attending the workshop.
Rammanoj:I got a confirmation,
Rammanoj:it is open to all who solve the tasks...
Rammanoj:not only first years.
Rammanoj:initially we thought it was only for the first years.... but I guess gopa has updated the plan..
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay awesome . That mean's we can do it on dec 22 as it's the start of holidays and people might stay for two or three days .
Rammanoj:
Rammanoj:you are hard to beat...... da
Vishwaak Chandran:Haha Thank you Anna.
Rammanoj:let me check with gopa
Rammanoj:will inform you by tuesday...
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay anna.
Rammanoj:Hey I am sorry I just had sem exam and mini project review today, i forgot about it
Rammanoj:I will get back to you tomorrow..
Vishwaak Chandran:Aha okay sure Anna
Vishwaak Chandran:Ping anna

The journey was comfortable. ￼ Morning of the event I reached Bangalore it was freaking 17 Celsius outside I was like enough I wore a jacket to protect me from the cold. I stayed over in a relatives house and from there my destination in White field was 45mins away. I booked a taxi and reached the place. This was where the real fun was there were two building of exactly of same size and dimension with people buzzing at the front gate I thought that would be the gateway to my place. I stood there for the next 20 mins in the entrance of the wrong building and when I enquired about the address it was the adjacent building and the adjacent building was a mall. Once I reached the front gate of the mall we had volunteers who took as to the place of the event K-Start. Such a wonderful place with a beautiful ambient. The conference started at 10 'o clock in the morning. ￼ We had talks from various speakers like Karthik Padmanabhan and Julia Aslamova. I had a nice time meeting and talking with people like Subhendu Panigrahi, CEO of Skillenza. Most of the talks were revolving around the word, community. ￼ Later on, it was the most important part of the day lunch break time. The food they served were hand cooked and was also very delicious causes it was made by the Love and care by the mom in Bangalore. ￼ Post lunch was a rapid-fire round between the speakers. The whole conference revolved around the building the developer community and developer relation. Last but not the least the google cupcake was the tasty snack of the day. The whole experience was a very wonderful one for the first time OSS Event. Wish I attend more of this event in the future.

Vishwaak Chandran:Italian
Vishwaak Chandran:talian cuisine is food typical of Italy. It has developed through centuries of social and economic changes, with roots stretching to antiquity.[1] Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century.[2][3] Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of the Italian peninsula.[4][5][6] It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world.[7] It influenced several cuisines around the world, chiefly that of the United States.
Vishwaak Chandran:western
Vishwaak Chandran:European cuisine, or alternatively western cuisine, is a generalised term collectively referring to the cuisines of Europe[1] and other Western countries,[2] including (depending on the definition) that of Russia,[2] as well as non-indigenous cuisines of the Americas, Oceania, and Southern Africa, which derive substantial influence from European settlers in those regions. The term is used by East Asians to contrast with Asian styles of cooking.[3] (This is analogous to Westerners' referring collectively to the cuisines of East Asian countries as Asian cuisine.) When used by Westerners, the term may sometimes refer more specifically to cuisine in Europe; in this context, a synonym is Continental cuisine, especially in British English
Vishwaak Chandran:thai food
Vishwaak Chandran:Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. Thai chef McDang characterises Thai food as demonstrating "intricacy; attention to detail; texture; color; taste; and the use of ingredients with medicinal benefits, as well as good flavor", as well as care being given to the food's appearance, smell and context.[1] Australian chef David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, observes that unlike many other cuisines,[2] Thai cooking rejects simplicity and is about "the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish".
Vishwaak Chandran:Indian
Vishwaak Chandran:Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hindu, cultural choices and traditions.[1] The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule, particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples

Vishwaak Chandran:I send it by mistake
Saurav:Haha ...okay ..
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you share the sheet to someone
Vishwaak Chandran:did you ?
Saurav:Okay i'm extremely sorry if I shouldn't have done that .. my roommates took it from me..
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay it's fine. Just don't share anymore .
Saurav:Is it confidential ..?? I never knew.. i' m sorry if I caused any inconveniences
Vishwaak Chandran:It's just a sheet with your names.
Vishwaak Chandran:It's fine just leave it.
Saurav:Okay
Saurav:
Saurav:Bro please help debugging . I am stuck at this for last 2 days..
Vishwaak Chandran:First try it out with hardcode email address.
Saurav:* hardcode email address * ??
Vishwaak Chandran:Yeah it means assign a email address to a variable.
Saurav:
Vishwaak Chandran:I guess now you understand where the error is.
Saurav:
Vishwaak Chandran:Did you understand your error?
Saurav:Yeah it's checking against a single character in my input string. My regex is wrong .. I ' ve to some way make it consider the entire thing before and after @ and .
Vishwaak Chandran:Okay cool.
Saurav:But how? is something that I still have to discover .. not so cool.
Vishwaak Chandran:First step in learning is to understand the error.
Saurav:Hmm you are right .. one thing that I must say is that debugging is taking way more time than writing the code itself.. no matter which task it is ... Hope with time I make less mistakes , so less debugging in the first place .
Vishwaak Chandran:Hey Why don't you have telegram ID ?

Nandana Krishna:Hey, didn't u suggest sending msgs through wifi or something to Krishnan ettan? Is that wat ur saying now? I don't understand. Cuz, as far as I knw, a basic gsm sends msgs through radio waves and somehow, wat u r saying doesn't make sense to me. Can u pls explain
Vishwaak Chandran:I wanted to transmit the distress call in a particular frequency just like they do in boats
Vishwaak Chandran:But Etta thought that it needs to be send through wifi
Vishwaak Chandran:Try checking out ham radios that's what I am talking about
Nandana Krishna:That is similar to a satellite phone and needs an international channel or something to function. I don't knw much about it, but we can't use it on a gsm module
Nandana Krishna:So, the only way to do something like that is through wifi
Nandana Krishna:Ohk. So, I just googled on it and Idk. Is it even available? Did u ask Krishnan ettan about this?
Vishwaak Chandran:I haven't asked him
Vishwaak Chandran:Once I get the complete data I will talk to him
